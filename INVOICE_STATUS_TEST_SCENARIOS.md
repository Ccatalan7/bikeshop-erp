# üß™ Invoice Status Logic - Complete Test Scenarios

## Status Transition Logic Summary

The `recalculate_sales_invoice_payments()` function determines invoice status based on:
1. Current status
2. Total payments received
3. Invoice total amount

## Complete Logic Decision Tree

```
IF cancelled:
  ‚Üí Keep 'cancelled'

ELSE IF draft:
  IF v_total >= invoice.total AND v_total > 0:
    ‚Üí 'paid'
  ELSE:
    ‚Üí Keep 'draft'

ELSE IF v_total >= invoice.total AND v_total > 0:
  ‚Üí 'paid' (fully paid)

ELSE IF v_total > 0 AND v_total < invoice.total:
  IF status = 'overdue':
    ‚Üí Keep 'overdue'
  ELSE:
    ‚Üí 'confirmed'

ELSE IF v_total = 0:
  IF status = 'paid':
    ‚Üí 'confirmed' (revert from paid)
  ELSE:
    ‚Üí Keep current status (draft/sent/confirmed/overdue)

ELSE:
  ‚Üí Keep current status (fallback)
```

```

### Scenario 6: Sent + Partial Payment ‚Üí Confirmed
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Create draft                    | -             | 0        | draft        | ‚úÖ
Mark as sent                    | draft         | 0        | sent         | ‚úÖ
Add partial payment ($500/$1000)| sent          | 500      | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** Partial payment from 'sent' should advance to 'confirmed' for tracking.

### Scenario 7: Overpayment Handling
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Create confirmed invoice ($1000)| -             | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Add payment ($1500)             | confirmed     | 1500     | paid         | ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** v_total >= invoice.total, so status becomes 'paid'.

### Scenario 8: Multiple Partial Payments
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Confirmed invoice ($1000)       | -             | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Add payment $300                | confirmed     | 300      | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Add payment $200                | confirmed     | 500      | confirmed    | ‚úÖ

Delete last payment             | paid          | 500      | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Delete second payment           | confirmed     | 300      | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Delete first payment            | confirmed     | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario 9: Draft Payment Then Delete
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Create draft invoice            | -             | 0        | draft        | ‚úÖ
Add full payment                | draft         | 1000     | paid         | ‚úÖ
Delete payment                  | paid          | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** Even though it was 'draft' before payment, deleting payment from 'paid' goes to 'confirmed' (not back to 'draft').

### Scenario 10: Cancelled Invoice (Immutable)
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Confirmed invoice               | -             | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
Cancel invoice                  | confirmed     | 0        | cancelled    | ‚úÖ
Attempt to add payment          | cancelled     | 1000     | cancelled    | ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** Cancelled status never changes regardless of payments.

### Scenario 11: Overdue Invoice
```
Action                          | Status Before | Payments | Status After | ‚úì
--------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---
Confirmed invoice (past due)    | -             | 0        | confirmed    | ‚úÖ
System sets to overdue          | confirmed     | 0        | overdue      | ‚úÖ
Add partial payment ($500/$1000)| overdue       | 500      | overdue      | ‚úÖ
Add remaining payment ($500)    | overdue       | 1000     | paid         | ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** Overdue status persists through partial payments until fully paid.

## üö® Edge Cases to Test

### Edge Case 1: Zero-Amount Invoice
```
Invoice total = $0
Add payment $0
Expected: Should handle gracefully (probably stay in current status)
```

### Edge Case 2: Negative Payment (Refund)
```
Confirmed invoice $1000
Add payment $1000 ‚Üí paid
Add payment -$1000 (refund) ‚Üí total = $0
Expected: Should revert to 'confirmed'
```

### Edge Case 3: Race Condition (Rapid Status Changes)
```
User clicks "Marcar como enviada"
Before trigger completes, user clicks "Confirmar"
Expected: Should end up in 'confirmed' state
```

### Edge Case 4: Manual Override During Payment
```
Invoice is 'sent'
Add payment $1000 (full) ‚Üí should become 'paid'
While trigger runs, user manually sets to 'cancelled'
Expected: Last write wins (probably 'paid' due to trigger)
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

If status transitions don't work:

1. **Check Supabase Logs:**
   ```sql
   -- Enable function logging
   SET client_min_messages TO NOTICE;
   
   -- Watch for these messages:
   -- "handle_sales_invoice_change: UPDATE invoice <id>, old status <x>, new status <y>"
   -- "recalculate_sales_invoice_payments: setting status to <status>"
   ```

2. **Check Payment Totals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     id,
     status,
     total,
     paid_amount,
     balance,
     (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM sales_payments WHERE invoice_id = si.id) as calculated_paid
   FROM sales_invoices si
   WHERE id = '<invoice-id>';
   ```

3. **Check Trigger Depth:**
   ```sql
   -- If trigger depth > 1, recalculate is skipped to prevent infinite recursion
   -- Look for: "trigger depth > 1, returning" in logs
   ```

4. **Verify Payment Records:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sales_payments WHERE invoice_id = '<invoice-id>' ORDER BY created_at;
   ```

## üé¨ Test Script (SQL)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to test programmatically:

```sql
-- Create test invoice
INSERT INTO sales_invoices (customer_id, invoice_number, date, total, status)
VALUES ('customer-uuid', 'TEST-001', NOW(), 1000.00, 'draft')
RETURNING id;

-- Test 1: Manual transition to sent
UPDATE sales_invoices SET status = 'sent' WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
SELECT status FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
-- Expected: sent

-- Test 2: Manual transition to confirmed
UPDATE sales_invoices SET status = 'confirmed' WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
SELECT status FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
-- Expected: confirmed

-- Test 3: Add full payment
INSERT INTO sales_payments (invoice_id, payment_method_id, amount, date)
SELECT id, (SELECT id FROM payment_methods WHERE code = 'cash'), 1000.00, NOW()
FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
SELECT status FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
-- Expected: paid

-- Test 4: Delete payment
DELETE FROM sales_payments WHERE invoice_id = (SELECT id FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001');
SELECT status FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
-- Expected: confirmed

-- Cleanup
DELETE FROM sales_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'TEST-001';
```
