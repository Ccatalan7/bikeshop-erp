# 📊 Purchase Invoice Workflow - Before vs After

## 🔴 BEFORE (Buggy Behavior)

### Scenario: Going back and forth twice

```
Step 1: Draft → Received
  ✅ Journal Entry: COMP-FC-001 (posted)
  ✅ Inventory: +10 units

Step 2: Received → Draft  
  ✅ Journal Entry: REV-COMP-FC-001 (posted - reversal)
  ✅ Original Entry: COMP-FC-001 (reversed)
  ✅ Inventory: -10 units

Step 3: Draft → Received (SECOND TIME)
  ❌ BUG: Only creates REV-COMP-FC-001-REV (another reversal!)
  ❌ Missing: New COMP-FC-001 entry
  ✅ Inventory: +10 units (this worked)
  
Step 4: Received → Draft (SECOND TIME)
  ❌ BUG: Creates REV-COMP-FC-001-REV-REV (reversal of reversal)
  ❌ Result: Confusing double/triple reversals
  ✅ Inventory: -10 units (this worked)
```

**Result in Journal Entries:**
```
COMP-FC-001 (REVERSADO) (REVERSADO)
↓
REV-COMP-FC-001 (Contabilizado) (REVERSADO)  
↓
REV-COMP-FC-001-REV (Contabilizado)
```
❌ This is confusing and incorrect!

---

### Scenario: Marking as Paid

```
Step 1: Draft → Received
  ✅ Journal Entry: COMP-FC-001 (posted)
  
Step 2: Received → Paid
  ❌ BUG: No payment journal entry created
  ❌ BUG: No payment record created
  ❌ Result: Accounts Payable not reduced
```

**Result**: Invoice shows as "paid" but accounting still shows full liability!

## 🟢 AFTER (Fixed Behavior)

### Scenario: Going back and forth twice

```
Step 1: Draft → Received
  ✅ Journal Entry: COMP-FC-001 (posted)
  ✅ Inventory: +10 units

Step 2: Received → Draft
  ✅ Original Entry: COMP-FC-001 (reversed)
  ✅ Reversal Entry: REV-COMP-FC-001 (posted)
  ✅ Inventory: -10 units

Step 3: Draft → Received (SECOND TIME)
  ✅ NEW ENTRY: COMP-FC-001 (posted) ← Fresh entry!
  ✅ Inventory: +10 units
  
Step 4: Received → Draft (SECOND TIME)
  ✅ Mark Entry: COMP-FC-001 (reversed)
  ✅ Reversal Entry: REV-COMP-FC-001 (posted)
  ✅ Inventory: -10 units
```

**Result in Journal Entries:**
```
COMP-FC-001 (REVERSADO) - First activation
↓
REV-COMP-FC-001 (Contabilizado) - First reversal
↓
COMP-FC-001 (REVERSADO) - Second activation  
↓
REV-COMP-FC-001 (Contabilizado) - Second reversal
```
✅ Clear audit trail with matching pairs!

    Debit:  Inventario (1105)        $100,000
    Debit:  IVA Crédito (1180)       $19,000
    Credit: Cuentas por Pagar (2101) $119,000
  
Step 2: Received → Paid
  ✅ Payment Created:
    - invoice_id: <invoice_uuid>
    - method: transfer
    - amount: $119,000
    - date: now()
    
  ✅ Payment Journal Entry: PAGO-FC-001 (posted)
    Debit:  Cuentas por Pagar (2101) $119,000
    Credit: Banco (1101)              $119,000

## 📈 Accounting Impact

### Before (Wrong)
```
After marking as paid:

Assets:
  Inventario (1105)          +$100,000 ✅
  IVA Crédito (1180)         +$19,000  ✅
  
Liabilities:
  Cuentas por Pagar (2101)   +$119,000 ❌ STILL THERE!

Cash:
  Banco (1101)               $0        ❌ NO CHANGE!
```
❌ Balance sheet is wrong! We show we owe $119,000 but we "paid" it!

---

### After (Correct)
```
After marking as paid:

Assets:
  Inventario (1105)          +$100,000 ✅
  IVA Crédito (1180)         +$19,000  ✅
  Banco (1101)               -$119,000 ✅ REDUCED!
  
Liabilities:
  Cuentas por Pagar (2101)   +$119,000 (on receive)
                             -$119,000 (on payment)
                             = $0      ✅ CLEARED!
```
✅ Perfect! Assets increased, liability incurred, then paid off!
