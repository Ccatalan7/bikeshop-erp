---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Order Flow (Manual Processing)

1. **Customer places order on website** (future store frontend)
   - Order inserted into `online_orders` table
   - Items inserted into `online_order_items` table
   - Order number auto-generated (e.g., `WEB-25-00001`)
   - Status: `pending`, Payment: `pending`

2. **Staff views order in ERP** (`/website` → Online Orders)
   - Order appears in list with all details
   - Customer info, items, totals visible

3. **Staff confirms order**
   - Click "Confirmar" button
   - Status changes to `confirmed`

4. **Payment received** (manually mark as paid for now)
   - In future: webhook from Stripe/MercadoPago
   - Payment status changes to `paid`

5. **Staff creates invoice**
   - Click "Crear Factura" button
   - Calls `process_online_order()` function
   - Invoice created automatically in sales_invoices
   - Order items → invoice items
   - Inventory reduced (existing triggers)
   - Journal entries created (existing triggers)
   - Link stored: `order.sales_invoice_id`

6. **Staff can view invoice**
   - Click "Ver Factura" button
   - Navigate to `/sales/invoices/{id}`
   - Full invoice detail page

### Database Synchronization

Everything uses the **SAME database** (no API, no sync delays!):

```
ERP App (Flutter Desktop/Web)
         ↓
    Supabase PostgreSQL ← SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
         ↓
Store Website (Future Flutter Web)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Real-time sync (same database)
- ✅ Zero data conflicts
- ✅ No API maintenance
- ✅ Instant inventory updates
- ✅ Unified customer data
- ✅ Single authentication system

## 📝 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Database Schema

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/Claudio/Dev/bikeshop-erp

# Deploy updated schema to Supabase
# Option A: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to SQL Editor
# 4. Copy contents of supabase/sql/core_schema.sql
# 5. Execute the SQL
```

**Verify deployment:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename LIKE 'website%' OR tablename LIKE 'online_%';

-- Expected result:
-- website_banners
-- featured_products
-- website_content
-- website_settings
-- online_orders
-- online_order_items

-- Check default data
SELECT * FROM website_settings;
SELECT * FROM website_content;
```

### 2. Run Flutter App

```bash
# Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
flutter run -d windows
# or
flutter run -d macos
# or
flutter run -d linux

# Web
flutter run -d chrome

# Mobile
flutter run -d android
# or
flutter run -d ios
```

### 3. Access Website Module

1. Open the app
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Click "Sitio Web" card (green, globe icon)
4. Explore:
   - Online Orders (fully functional!)
   - Other sections (placeholders for now)

---

## 🧪 Testing the Module

### Test Order Processing Flow

```sql
-- Insert a test order directly in database
INSERT INTO online_orders (
  order_number,
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  customer_phone,
  subtotal,
  tax_amount,
  shipping_cost,
  discount_amount,
  total,
  status,
  payment_status
) VALUES (
  'WEB-25-00001',
  'test@example.com',
  'Cliente de Prueba',
  '+56 9 1234 5678',
  100000,
  19000,
  5000,
  0,
  124000,
  'pending',
  'paid'
);

-- Get the order ID (use actual ID from previous insert)
-- Replace 'YOUR_ORDER_ID' with actual UUID
SELECT * FROM online_orders WHERE order_number = 'WEB-25-00001';

-- Add test order items (replace YOUR_ORDER_ID and YOUR_PRODUCT_ID)
INSERT INTO online_order_items (
  order_id,
  product_id,
  product_name,
  product_sku,
  quantity,
  unit_price,
  subtotal
)
SELECT 
  'YOUR_ORDER_ID'::uuid,
  id,
  name,
  sku,
  2,
  price,
  price * 2
FROM products
LIMIT 1;
```

**Then in the ERP:**
1. Go to Website → Online Orders
2. See your test order
3. Click "Crear Factura"
4. Check invoice created successfully
5. Navigate to Sales → Invoices to verify

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Database schema deployed
- ✅ Flutter module integrated
- ✅ Navigation working
- ✅ Order viewing and filtering
- ✅ Order status updates
- ✅ Invoice creation from orders
- ✅ Full ERP integration

### Still TODO
- ⏳ Banner upload and management UI
- ⏳ Featured products selection UI
- ⏳ Content editor (rich text)
- ⏳ Settings configuration form
- ⏳ Customer-facing store website
- ⏳ Payment gateway integration
- ⏳ Google Merchant feed
- ⏳ Product visibility controls in inventory module

---

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why No API?
**Direct database access** = simpler, faster, no sync issues!
- ERP and Store share Supabase PostgreSQL
- Row Level Security handles permissions
- Supabase handles auth and real-time updates
- No custom API to build/maintain

### Why Placeholders for Some Pages?
**Agile development approach:**
- Core functionality (orders) first
- Polish UI later
- Get feedback early
- Iterate quickly

### Why Separate Store App Later?
**Separation of concerns:**
- ERP = internal staff tool (complex, full-featured)
- Store = customer-facing (simple, beautiful)
- Different UX requirements
- Different deployment targets (ERP = desktop, Store = web)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Website module not showing on dashboard"
- Check `dashboard_screen.dart` has the card
- Verify `/website` route in `app_router.dart`
- Restart Flutter app

### "WebsiteService not found"
- Check `main.dart` has `ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => WebsiteService())`
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Restart IDE

### "Database tables not found"
- Deploy `core_schema.sql` to Supabase
- Check connection in Supabase dashboard
- Verify RLS policies allow reading

### "Order invoice creation fails"
- Check product_id exists in products table
- Verify customer_id (can be null for guest checkout)
- Check function exists: `SELECT process_online_order('order-id-here');`
