## 🔴 What YOU Need To Do (Only 1 Thing!)

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration in Supabase

**This is the ONLY manual step required!**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com
   - Log in to your account
   - Select your project (the one for VinaBike ERP)

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor"
   - Click "+ New query" button

3. **Copy and Paste the SQL**
   - Open this file in VS Code: `supabase/sql/add_supplier_to_products.sql`
   - Select all the content (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy it (Ctrl+C)
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

4. **Run the Script**
   - Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Wait for it to complete (should take 1-2 seconds)
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned" or similar

5. **Done!** 🎉

## 🧪 How to Test (After Running SQL)

### Test 1: Create a Product with Supplier
1. Run the app: `flutter run -d windows`
2. Go to: Inventario → Productos
3. Click "+ Nuevo Producto"
4. Fill out the form
5. **Look for the "Proveedor" dropdown** (it should be there!)
6. Select a supplier (or leave as "Sin proveedor")
7. Save the product

### Test 2: View Products from Supplier
1. Go to: Compras → Proveedores
2. **Toggle between List and Grid views** (buttons at the top)
3. Click on any supplier
4. You should see the products page filtered by that supplier
5. Check the URL - it should show `?supplier=<id>`

### Test 3: See Supplier Info in Product List
1. Go to: Inventario → Productos
2. Look at the products in the list
3. You should see supplier name displayed with a business icon 🏢
4. Try both Table and Card views

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: SQL script fails to run
- **Check**: Make sure you're running it in the correct project
- **Check**: Make sure the `products` table exists
- **Solution**: Copy the error message and paste it in the chat

### Problem: "Proveedor" dropdown doesn't appear in product form
- **Check**: Did you run the SQL migration?
- **Check**: Restart the Flutter app after running SQL
- **Solution**: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter run -d windows`

### Problem: Can't see suppliers in the dropdown
- **Check**: Do you have suppliers created? (Go to Compras → Proveedores)
- **Solution**: Create at least one supplier first

## 📊 What Changed (Technical Summary)

- Added `supplier_id` column to `products` table
- Added `supplier_name` column to `products` table (auto-updated)

- Created trigger to auto-update supplier name when changed

### Code Changes (Already Done)
- `product_form_page.dart`: Added supplier dropdown
- `product_list_page.dart`: Shows supplier in table and card views
- `supplier_list_page.dart`: List/Grid toggle, navigate to products

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Supplier is optional** - Products can be created without a supplier
2. **Supplier name auto-updates** - If you change a supplier's name, it updates automatically in all products
3. **Use both filters** - You can filter products by both category AND supplier at the same time
4. **Grid view is cool** - Try the grid view in the supplier list page!
