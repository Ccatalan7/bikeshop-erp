## üóÑÔ∏è Database Deployment

### **Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)**

#### **Step 1: Backup Existing Data (CRITICAL)**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run these queries:

-- Backup sales_payments
CREATE TABLE sales_payments_backup AS SELECT * FROM sales_payments;

-- Backup purchase_payments
CREATE TABLE purchase_payments_backup AS SELECT * FROM purchase_payments;

-- Backup sales_invoices
CREATE TABLE sales_invoices_backup AS SELECT * FROM sales_invoices;

-- Backup purchase_invoices
CREATE TABLE purchase_invoices_backup AS SELECT * FROM purchase_invoices;

-- Verify backups created
SELECT COUNT(*) as sales_payments_backup FROM sales_payments_backup;
SELECT COUNT(*) as purchase_payments_backup FROM purchase_payments_backup;
SELECT COUNT(*) as sales_invoices_backup FROM sales_invoices_backup;
SELECT COUNT(*) as purchase_invoices_backup FROM purchase_invoices_backup;
```

#### **Step 2: Deploy Schema**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Create new query
3. Copy entire contents of `supabase/sql/core_schema.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" (‚ö° icon)
6. Wait for completion (~30-60 seconds)
7. Check for success message

#### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
```sql
-- Check payment_methods table exists and has data
SELECT * FROM payment_methods WHERE is_active = true ORDER BY sort_order;
-- Expected: 4 rows (cash, transfer, card, check)

-- Check sales_payments has correct columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'sales_payments' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
-- Expected columns: id, invoice_id, date, amount, payment_method_id, reference, notes, created_at, updated_at

-- Check purchase_payments has correct columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'purchase_payments' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
-- Expected columns: id, invoice_id, date, amount, payment_method_id, reference, notes, created_at, updated_at

-- Check products has new columns
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'products' 
  AND column_name IN ('product_type', 'barcode', 'brand', 'model', 'description');
-- Expected: 5 rows

-- Check recalculate function exists
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'recalculate_sales_invoice_payments';
-- Expected: 1 row

-- Check triggers are active
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public' 
  AND event_object_table IN ('sales_invoices', 'sales_payments', 'purchase_invoices', 'purchase_payments')
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
-- Expected: At least 4 triggers
```

#### **Step 4: Test Data Migration**
```sql
-- Verify old payment data migrated correctly
SELECT 
  sp.id,
  sp.invoice_id,
  sp.date,
  sp.amount,
  sp.payment_method_id,
  pm.name as payment_method_name
FROM sales_payments sp
LEFT JOIN payment_methods pm ON pm.id = sp.payment_method_id
ORDER BY sp.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for any NULL payment_method_id (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_payment_methods
FROM sales_payments
WHERE payment_method_id IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0

-- Same for purchase_payments
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_payment_methods
FROM purchase_payments
WHERE payment_method_id IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0
```

---

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### **Test 1: Payment Methods Dropdown** (2 minutes)
- [ ] Sales ‚Üí Invoice Detail ‚Üí Registrar Pago
- [ ] Verify dropdown shows: Efectivo, Transferencia, Tarjeta, Cheque
- [ ] Verify icons display correctly (üí∞ üè¶ üí≥ üßæ)
- [ ] Purchase ‚Üí Invoice Detail ‚Üí Registrar Pago
- [ ] Verify same payment methods appear

### **Test 2: Reference Field Validation** (3 minutes)
- [ ] Select "Efectivo" ‚Üí Reference field optional (no asterisk)
- [ ] Select "Transferencia" ‚Üí Reference field required (red asterisk)
- [ ] Try to save without reference ‚Üí Should show validation error
- [ ] Enter reference ‚Üí Save should succeed
- [ ] Select "Cheque" ‚Üí Reference field required
- [ ] Same behavior in both Sales and Purchase modules

### **Test 3: Invoice Status Transitions** (5 minutes)

- [ ] Click "Confirmar" ‚Üí Status = 'confirmed'
- [ ] Add full payment ‚Üí Status = 'paid'
- [ ] Delete payment ‚Üí Status = 'confirmed' (NOT 'sent' or 'draft')
- [ ] Click "Volver a enviada" ‚Üí Status = 'sent'
- [ ] Click "Volver a borrador" ‚Üí Status = 'draft'

### **Test 4: Partial Payments** (5 minutes)
- [ ] Create invoice: $100,000
- [ ] Add payment: $50,000
- [ ] Status = 'confirmed' (not 'paid')
- [ ] Balance = $50,000
- [ ] Add payment: $50,000
- [ ] Status = 'paid'
- [ ] Balance = $0

### **Test 5: Journal Entries** (3 minutes)

### **Test 6: Database Consistency** (2 minutes)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Check all payments have valid payment_method_id
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_payments
FROM sales_payments sp
LEFT JOIN payment_methods pm ON pm.id = sp.payment_method_id
WHERE pm.id IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0

-- Check invoice totals match payments
SELECT 
  si.invoice_number,
  si.total,
  si.paid_amount,
  si.balance,
  COALESCE(SUM(sp.amount), 0) as calculated_paid,
  si.paid_amount - COALESCE(SUM(sp.amount), 0) as difference
FROM sales_invoices si
LEFT JOIN sales_payments sp ON sp.invoice_id = si.id
GROUP BY si.id, si.invoice_number, si.total, si.paid_amount, si.balance
HAVING ABS(si.paid_amount - COALESCE(SUM(sp.amount), 0)) > 0.01;
-- Expected: 0 rows (all match)

-- Check journal entries exist for all invoices
SELECT 
  si.invoice_number,
  si.status,
  COUNT(je.id) as journal_entry_count
FROM sales_invoices si
LEFT JOIN journal_entries je ON je.source_reference = si.id::text
WHERE si.status IN ('confirmed', 'paid')
GROUP BY si.id, si.invoice_number, si.status
HAVING COUNT(je.id) = 0;
-- Expected: 0 rows (all have entries)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### **Option 1: Restore from Backup**
```sql
-- Drop new tables (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payment_methods CASCADE;

-- Restore old sales_payments
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_payments CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE sales_payments AS SELECT * FROM sales_payments_backup;

-- Restore old purchase_payments
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS purchase_payments CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE purchase_payments AS SELECT * FROM purchase_payments_backup;

-- Restore old sales_invoices
TRUNCATE TABLE sales_invoices;
INSERT INTO sales_invoices SELECT * FROM sales_invoices_backup;

-- Restore old purchase_invoices
TRUNCATE TABLE purchase_invoices;
INSERT INTO purchase_invoices SELECT * FROM purchase_invoices_backup;
```

### **Option 2: Re-deploy Old Schema**
1. Checkout previous git commit
2. Copy old `core_schema.sql`
3. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Restart Flutter app with old code

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "column payment_method_id does not exist"**
**Solution:** Migration didn't run. Re-deploy core_schema.sql

### **Issue: Dropdown shows no payment methods**
**Solution:** Check payment_methods table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM payment_methods WHERE is_active = true;
```
If empty, re-run seed section of core_schema.sql

### **Issue: Reference field not showing as required**
**Solution:** Check payment_method.requires_reference:
```sql
UPDATE payment_methods SET requires_reference = true WHERE code IN ('transfer', 'check');
```

### **Issue: Journal entries not created automatically**
**Solution:** Check triggers are active:
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_table = 'sales_invoices';
```
If missing, re-deploy trigger section of core_schema.sql

### **Issue: Status stuck on wrong value**
**Solution:** Manually recalculate:
```sql
SELECT public.recalculate_sales_invoice_payments('<invoice-id>');
```
