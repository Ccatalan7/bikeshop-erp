# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG #9: Trigger Using Old Column Name `purchase_invoice_id`

## 📋 Summary
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Payment registration completely broken  
**Module**: Purchases → Payment Registration  
**Impact**: Unable to record ANY purchase payments (both standard and prepayment models)  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 The Problem

### User Error Message
```
Error al registrar el pago: PostgrestException(message: record "new" has no field "purchase_invoice_id", code: 42703, details: Bad Request, hint: null)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**PostgreSQL Trigger Type Caching Issue**

When a trigger passes a row variable (like `NEW` or `OLD`) to a function that expects a composite type, PostgreSQL caches the **type definition** at the time the function/trigger was created.

**The Timeline:**
1. ✅ Table `purchase_payments` was created with column `purchase_invoice_id`
2. ✅ Trigger `trg_purchase_payments_change` was created
3. ✅ Trigger cached type definition: `purchase_payments(id, purchase_invoice_id, amount, ...)`
4. ✅ Migration renamed column: `purchase_invoice_id` → `invoice_id`
5. ❌ Trigger STILL uses old cached type definition
6. ❌ When Flutter inserts payment, trigger passes `NEW` with old field names
7. ❌ Function receives row but PostgreSQL tries to access `NEW.purchase_invoice_id`
8. 💥 **ERROR**: field doesn't exist in NEW record

**The Specific Flow That Failed:**
```
Flutter INSERT payment
  ↓
Trigger: trg_purchase_payments_change fires
  ↓
Calls: handle_purchase_payment_change()
  ↓
Passes: NEW (with old type definition from cache)
  ↓
Function: create_purchase_payment_journal_entry(NEW)
  ↓
PostgreSQL tries to access: NEW.purchase_invoice_id
  ↓
💥 ERROR: "record 'new' has no field 'purchase_invoice_id'"
```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The trigger creation logic used a conditional check:
```sql
do $$
begin
  if not exists (...check if trigger exists...) then
    create trigger trg_purchase_payments_change ...
  end if;
end $$;
```

**The Problem:**
- ✅ If trigger doesn't exist → creates it (good)
- ❌ If trigger already exists → does NOTHING (bad!)
- ❌ Old trigger keeps using cached type definition with old column names
- ❌ Migration renamed column but trigger wasn't recreated

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Changes Made to `core_schema.sql`

**Replaced conditional trigger creation** (line ~2363):

**BEFORE (BROKEN):**
```sql
do $$
begin
  if not exists (
    select 1 from pg_trigger t
    join pg_class c on c.oid = t.tgrelid
    join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
    where n.nspname = 'public'
      and c.relname = 'purchase_payments'
      and t.tgname = 'trg_purchase_payments_change'
  ) then
    create trigger trg_purchase_payments_change
      after insert or update or delete on public.purchase_payments
      for each row execute procedure public.handle_purchase_payment_change();
  end if;
end $$;
```

**AFTER (FIXED):**
```sql
-- CRITICAL: Drop and recreate trigger to ensure it uses latest column names
-- This fixes the "record 'new' has no field 'purchase_invoice_id'" error
drop trigger if exists trg_purchase_payments_change on public.purchase_payments;

create trigger trg_purchase_payments_change
  after insert or update or delete on public.purchase_payments
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_purchase_payment_change();
```

### How It Works
1. **DROP IF EXISTS**: Removes old trigger with cached type definition
2. **CREATE**: Creates new trigger with current type definition
3. **Type Cache Refresh**: New trigger uses updated column names (invoice_id)
4. **Safe for fresh installs**: DROP IF EXISTS won't error if trigger doesn't exist
5. **Safe for upgrades**: Always recreates trigger with latest column names

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### After Deploying core_schema.sql

- [ ] **Test 1: Standard Invoice Payment**
  1. Create standard purchase invoice (prepayment_model = false)
  2. Confirm invoice (status → 'confirmed')
  3. Receive goods (status → 'received')
  4. Click "Registrar Pago"
  5. Fill payment details and save
  6. **Expected**: Payment saves successfully, no "purchase_invoice_id" error
  7. **Verify**: Status changes to 'paid'

- [ ] **Test 2: Prepayment Invoice Payment**
  1. Create prepayment invoice (prepayment_model = true)
  2. Confirm invoice (status → 'confirmed')
  3. Click "Registrar Pago" (payment BEFORE receiving)
  4. Fill payment details and save
  5. **Expected**: Payment saves, status changes to 'paid'
  6. **Verify**: No database errors

- [ ] **Test 3: Partial Payment**
  1. Create invoice for $100,000
  2. Register payment for $50,000
  3. **Expected**: Payment saves, status stays 'received' (standard) or 'paid' (prepayment)
  4. Register second payment for $50,000
  5. **Expected**: Status changes to 'paid', balance = 0

- [ ] **Test 4: Journal Entry Creation**
  1. Register payment
  2. **Expected**: Journal entry created automatically
  3. **Verify in database**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM journal_entries 
     WHERE source_module = 'purchase_payments' 
     ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
     ```

- [ ] **Test 5: Payment with Different Methods**
  1. Test payment with Cash
  2. Test payment with Bank Transfer (requires reference)
  3. Test payment with Credit Card
  4. Test payment with Check (requires reference)
  5. **Expected**: All payment methods work, no errors

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### PostgreSQL Trigger Type Caching
1. **Triggers cache composite types**: When passing row variables to functions
2. **Column renames require trigger recreation**: Simply renaming columns isn't enough
3. **Always DROP and CREATE**: Don't use conditional "IF NOT EXISTS" for triggers that depend on table structure
4. **Pattern for schema evolution**:
   ```sql
   -- Step 1: Rename column
   ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;
   
   -- Step 2: Drop and recreate triggers
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON table_name;
   CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name ...
   ```

### Fix Pattern for This Project
All triggers that pass `NEW` or `OLD` to functions should use:
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON table_name;
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name ...
```

Instead of:
```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (...) THEN
    CREATE TRIGGER ...
  END IF;
END $$;
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- ❌ **ZERO payments could be saved** (both standard and prepayment)
- ❌ Error: "record 'new' has no field 'purchase_invoice_id'"
- ❌ Purchase payment workflow completely broken
- ❌ No way to mark invoices as paid
- ❌ Journal entries not created
- ❌ Application unusable for supplier payments

### After Fix
- ✅ Payments save successfully
- ✅ Trigger uses correct column names (invoice_id)

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

**CRITICAL**: This fix MUST be deployed to production ASAP - payment registration is completely broken without it.

1. **Deploy updated core_schema.sql**:
   - Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Copy entire `core_schema.sql` file (3904 lines)
   - Paste and run
   - Watch for messages:
     - `"Renaming purchase_invoice_id to invoice_id..."` (if needed)
     - `"DROP TRIGGER"` (removing old trigger)
     - `"CREATE TRIGGER"` (creating new trigger)
   - Verify no errors

2. **Verify trigger recreation**:
   ```sql
   -- Check trigger exists and is recent
   SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass, proname
   FROM pg_trigger t
   JOIN pg_proc p ON p.oid = t.tgfoid
   WHERE tgname = 'trg_purchase_payments_change';
   ```

3. **Test payment registration immediately**:
   - Try saving a payment on both standard and prepayment invoices
   - Verify no "purchase_invoice_id" error
   - Check journal entries created

4. **Verify data integrity**:
   ```sql
   -- Check recent payments
   SELECT id, invoice_id, amount, date, payment_method_id
   FROM purchase_payments
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   
   -- Check journal entries created
   SELECT je.*, jl.account_code, jl.debit_amount, jl.credit_amount
   FROM journal_entries je
   JOIN journal_lines jl ON jl.entry_id = je.id
   WHERE je.source_module = 'purchase_payments'
   ORDER BY je.created_at DESC;
   ```

- **Bug #8**: Missing `date` column (CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_PAYMENTS_DATE.md)
- **Bug #5**: Missing columns in purchase_invoices (FIX_MISSING_PURCHASE_INVOICE_COLUMNS.md)
- **Pattern**: Schema evolution requires careful trigger management

### Similar Triggers to Check
Other triggers that might need the same fix pattern:
- ✅ `trg_purchase_invoices_change` (already uses DROP IF EXISTS pattern)
- ✅ `trg_sales_invoices_change` (already uses DROP IF EXISTS pattern)
- ✅ `trg_sales_payments_change` (check if uses old pattern)

## 🔍 Prevention Strategy

### Code Review Checklist
When renaming table columns that are used by triggers:
1. ✅ Rename the column in table definition
2. ✅ Update all function code that references the column
3. ✅ **DROP and RECREATE all triggers** that pass NEW/OLD rows
4. ✅ Test with actual INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
5. ✅ Verify trigger functions execute successfully

### Testing Strategy
After ANY column rename:
1. Test INSERT (trigger with NEW record)
2. Test UPDATE (trigger with NEW and OLD records)
3. Test DELETE (trigger with OLD record)
4. Check error logs for "has no field" errors
5. Verify data flows through entire trigger chain
