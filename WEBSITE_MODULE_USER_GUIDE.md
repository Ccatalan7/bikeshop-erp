## 🧪 Testing the Current System

### **Test 1: Create a Test Order**

Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create test order
INSERT INTO online_orders (
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  customer_phone,
  customer_address,
  subtotal,
  tax_amount,
  shipping_cost,
  total,
  status,
  payment_status
) VALUES (
  'test@vinabike.cl',
  'Cliente de Prueba',
  '+56 9 1234 5678',
  'Av. Principal 123, Santiago',
  100000,
  19000,
  5000,
  124000,
  'pending',
  'paid'
) RETURNING id;

-- Copy the returned ID, then add items (replace YOUR_ORDER_ID):
INSERT INTO online_order_items (
  order_id, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  product_sku,
  quantity, 
  unit_price, 
  subtotal
)
SELECT 
  'YOUR_ORDER_ID'::uuid,
  id,
  name,
  sku,
  2,
  price,
  price * 2
FROM products 
WHERE stock_quantity > 0
LIMIT 2;
```

### **Test 2: View Order in ERP**

1. Open ERP app
2. Go to Website → Online Orders
3. See your test order
4. Filter by "Paid" status
5. Click "Crear Factura"
6. Verify invoice was created

### **Test 3: Check Inventory**

1. Go to Inventory module
2. Check the products you ordered
3. Verify stock decreased by order quantity

### **Test 4: Check Accounting**

## 🎓 Understanding the Data Flow

### **When a Customer Places an Order:**

```
1. Customer Website
   ↓ (Submits order)
   
2. Supabase: online_orders table
   ↓ (Trigger: auto-generate order number)
   Order number: WEB-25-00001
   
3. ERP: Online Orders Page
   ↓ (Staff clicks "Crear Factura")
   
4. Supabase: process_online_order() function
   ↓ (Creates invoice + items)
   
5. Sales Invoices Table
   ↓ (Trigger: handle_sales_invoice_change)
   
6. Inventory Deduction
   ↓ (Trigger: consume_inventory)
   
7. Journal Entries Created
   ↓ (Debit: Accounts Receivable, Credit: Sales Revenue)
   
8. Complete! ✨
```

**Key Point:** Everything happens automatically! You just need to:
1. Customer places order on website
2. You click "Crear Factura" in ERP
3. Done!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Can't see "Sitio Web" on dashboard**

2. Verify Website card is present (should be green with globe icon)

4. Restart app

### **Issue: Online Orders page is empty**
**Solution:**
1. Create test orders in database (see SQL above)
2. Check Supabase connection

**Solution:**
1. Verify order is marked as "paid"
2. Check order has items
3. Check products exist and have stock
4. Check console for errors

### **Issue: Google Merchant feed returns error**
**Solution:**

## 🤔 Need Help?

### **Common Questions**

**Q: How do I add products to the website?**
A: Set `show_on_website = true` in products table. Add images and descriptions.

**Q: How do customers pay?**
A: You need to integrate Stripe or MercadoPago on the public website. ERP just manages orders.

**Q: Can I edit orders after they're placed?**
A: No, orders are immutable for audit trail. Cancel and create new order if needed.

**Q: How do I change order status?**
A: Use the status buttons in Online Orders page (Confirm, Cancel).

**Q: What if invoice creation fails?**
A: Check console errors. Usually means product missing or insufficient stock.
