# 🖼️ Website Banner Image Upload - FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The banner image upload feature in the Odoo-style visual editor now **actually uploads images to Supabase Storage** instead of just showing a "TODO" message.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added imports** to `odoo_style_editor_page.dart`:
   - `ImageService` for handling uploads
   - `StorageConfig` for bucket configuration

2. **Implemented `_pickImage()` function** with full upload logic:
   - Picks image from gallery (max 1920×1080, 85% quality)
   - Shows uploading progress indicator
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage (`vinabike-assets` bucket)
   - Updates the selected block with new image URL
   - Auto-saves if auto-save is enabled
   - Shows success/error notifications

3. **Better error handling**:
   - Validates that a block is selected before picking image
   - Shows clear error messages if upload fails
   - Hides loading snackbar on completion

## 🪣 **IMPORTANT: Create Supabase Storage Bucket**

Before using the image upload feature, you **MUST** create the storage bucket in Supabase:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard

1. Open your Supabase project: [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Click on **"Storage"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Create Bucket

1. Click **"Create new bucket"** (green button)
2. **Bucket name:** `vinabike-assets`
3. **Public bucket:** ✅ **YES** (check this box!)
   - This allows images to be displayed on the website without authentication
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

### Step 3: (Optional) Create Folder Structure

Inside the `vinabike-assets` bucket, you can create folders:
- `website/banners` → Banner images
- `website/products` → Product images
- `website/gallery` → Gallery images

**Note:** Folders are created automatically when you upload files, so this step is optional.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Storage bucket not found"

**Solution:** Create the `vinabike-assets` bucket in Supabase Dashboard (see instructions above)

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Make sure the bucket is set to **public** in Supabase:
1. Go to Storage → vinabike-assets
2. Click ⚙️ Settings
3. Enable **"Public bucket"**
4. Save

### Error: "Failed to upload image"

**Possible causes:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure file size is reasonable (< 5MB recommended)

### Image doesn't update immediately

**Solution:** 
- Check if auto-save is enabled (toggle in top-right)
- If disabled, click **"💾 Guardar"** button manually
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

## 📊 Image Upload Best Practices

### Recommended Image Specs:

| Type | Dimensions | Format | Quality | Max Size |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Hero Banner | 1920×1080 | JPEG | 85% | 500KB |
| Product Image | 800×800 | JPEG/PNG | 90% | 200KB |
| Gallery Image | 1200×800 | JPEG | 85% | 400KB |
| Thumbnail | 300×300 | JPEG | 80% | 50KB |

### Why These Specs?

- **1920×1080:** Standard Full HD resolution, works on all screens
- **JPEG 85%:** Best balance between quality and file size
- **< 500KB:** Fast loading on mobile connections
- **ImagePicker auto-resizes:** Images larger than 1920×1080 are automatically scaled down
