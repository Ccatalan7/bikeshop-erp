# 🔄 Purchase Invoice Reversal - Quick Deployment

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Database Layer (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ `reverse_purchase_invoice_inventory()` - Reverses stock movements
- ✅ `reverse_purchase_invoice_journal_entry()` - Creates reversing entries
- ✅ `handle_purchase_invoice_reversal()` - Trigger for backward transitions
- ✅ Two triggers working together (BEFORE for reversal, AFTER for forward)

### Application Layer (Dart/Flutter)
- ✅ `revertToDraft()` - Service method
- ✅ `revertToReceived()` - Service method
- ✅ UI buttons for all transitions
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs with warnings
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Changes
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```
Copy/paste the entire contents of:
**`supabase/sql/purchase_invoice_reversal.sql`**

Expected output:
- Functions created successfully
- Triggers created successfully
- Verification queries showing current state

### Step 2: Restart Flutter App
```bash
# Stop the running app (if any), then:
flutter run -d windows
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature

#### Test Forward Flow
1. Create a new purchase invoice
   - Add product: "Producto Test" x 10 units
   - Note current inventory (e.g., 5 units)
2. Click **"Marcar como Recibida"** (green button)
   - ✅ Status → Recibida (green chip)
   - ✅ Inventory increases to 15 units
   - ✅ Journal entry created (COMP-XXX)
3. Click **"Marcar como Pagada"** (blue button)
   - ✅ Status → Pagada (blue chip)

#### Test Backward Flow
4. Click **"Volver a Recibida"** (orange button)
   - ✅ Confirmation dialog appears
   - ✅ Status → Recibida
   - ✅ Inventory stays at 15 (no change)
5. Click **"Volver a Borrador"** (gray button)
   - ⚠️ Warning dialog appears
   - ✅ Status → Borrador (gray chip)
   - ✅ Inventory decreases to 5 units (original)
   - ✅ Reversing entry created (REV-COMP-XXX)

### Step 4: Verify Results

#### Check Stock Movements
```sql
SELECT 
  type,
  movement_type,
  quantity,
  notes,
  created_at
FROM stock_movements
WHERE movement_type = 'purchase_invoice'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** 
- No IN movements remain (all deleted during reversal)

#### Check Journal Entries
```sql
SELECT 
  entry_number,
  type,
  status,
  description,
  (SELECT SUM(debit_amount) FROM journal_lines WHERE entry_id = je.id) as debit,
  (SELECT SUM(credit_amount) FROM journal_lines WHERE entry_id = je.id) as credit
FROM journal_entries je
WHERE source_module IN ('purchase_invoice', 'purchase_invoice_reversal')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:**
- Original entry: status = 'reversed'
- Reversing entry: type = 'reversal', status = 'posted'
- Both entries balance each other

## 🎯 UI Button Matrix

| Current Status | Forward Button | Backward Button |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Draft** | 🟢 Marcar como Recibida | *(none)* |
| **Received** | 🔵 Marcar como Pagada | ⚫ Volver a Borrador |
| **Paid** | *(none)* | 🟠 Volver a Recibida<br>⚫ Volver a Borrador |

## ⚠️ Important Behaviors

### Safety Checks
1. **Insufficient Inventory Check:**
   - If you try to revert but don't have enough inventory
   - **Error:** "Cannot reverse: insufficient inventory"
   - Transaction rolls back, status unchanged

2. **Audit Trail:**
   - Original entries are NEVER deleted
   - They are marked as 'reversed'
   - Reversing entries are created separately
   - Full history preserved

3. **User Confirmations:**
   - Different dialogs for different actions
   - Clear warnings about consequences
   - Explicit "Sí, revertir" button required

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Simple Reversal ✅
```
1. Create invoice: 10 units @ $100
2. Receive → Inventory +10, Entry created
3. Revert → Inventory -10, Reversing entry
Result: Everything back to original state
```

### Test Case 2: Insufficient Inventory ❌
```
1. Create invoice: 10 units
2. Receive → Inventory +10
3. Sell 8 units → Inventory = 2
4. Try revert → ERROR (need 10, have 2)
Result: Status unchanged, error message shown
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Transitions ✅
```
1. Draft → Received → Paid
2. Paid → Received (status only)
3. Received → Draft (full reversal)
Result: All inventory and accounting reversed
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Forward buttons appear in correct states
- [ ] Backward buttons appear in correct states
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs show with correct messages
- [ ] Inventory increases on receive
- [ ] Inventory decreases on revert
- [ ] Journal entries created on receive
- [ ] Reversing entries created on revert
- [ ] Original entries marked as 'reversed'
- [ ] Error handling works (insufficient inventory)
- [ ] Status chips update correctly
- [ ] Success messages display
- [ ] Error messages display

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buttons don't appear
**Check:** App was restarted after code changes?
```bash
flutter run -d windows
```

### Issue: "Function does not exist"
**Check:** SQL script was run in Supabase?
```sql
-- Verify functions exist:
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%reverse%purchase%';
```

### Issue: Reversal fails silently
**Check:** Supabase logs for detailed error:
```sql
-- Check PostgreSQL logs in Supabase Dashboard
-- Look for NOTICE and WARNING messages
```

### Issue: Inventory doesn't update
**Check:** Triggers are installed:
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_timing
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'purchase_invoices';
```

Expected:
- `purchase_invoice_reversal_trigger` (BEFORE UPDATE)
- `purchase_invoice_change_trigger` (AFTER INSERT, UPDATE)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Possible additions (not implemented yet):

1. **Reversal Reason Field**
   - Add text field to explain why reversal
   - Store in database for audit

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - Require manager approval for reversals
   - Especially for high-value invoices

3. **Reversal History**
   - Track who reversed and when
   - Show in UI

4. **Partial Reversal**
   - Allow reversing specific line items
   - Not the entire invoice

5. **Payment Reversal**
   - When payment system is implemented
   - Reverse payment transactions too

## ✅ Ready to Deploy!

All code is written, tested for compilation, and documented.

**Just run the SQL script and restart your app!** 🚀

**Questions to Test:**
1. Can you go Draft → Received → Draft?
2. Can you go Received → Paid → Received → Draft?
3. Does it fail gracefully when inventory is insufficient?
4. Do both journal entries show in accounting view?
5. Is the net effect zero after reversal?

All should answer **YES** ✅
