## ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

### 1. Standard Model Forward Flow

**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → Received → Paid

| Step | Action | Inventory | Journal | Payment Journal | Status | Verified |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create invoice (draft) | No change | No change | - | draft | ✅ |
| 2 | Mark as sent | No change | No change | - | sent | ✅ |
| 3 | Confirm invoice | No change | **CREATE** invoice journal | - | confirmed | ✅ |
| 4 | Mark as received | **+ADD inventory** | No change | - | received | ✅ |
| 5 | Register payment | No change | No change | **CREATE** payment journal | paid | ✅ |

**Trigger Behavior:**
- ✅ Inventory consumed ONLY at 'received' (step 4)
- ✅ Invoice journal created ONCE at 'confirmed' (step 3)
- ✅ Payment journal created when payment registered (step 5)
- ✅ Status advances correctly at each step

### 2. Standard Model Backward Flow

**Workflow**: Paid → Received → Confirmed → Sent → Draft

| Step | Action | Inventory | Journal | Payment Journal | Status | Verified |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Start at paid | Inventory +10 | Invoice journal exists | Payment journal exists | paid | ✅ |
| 2 | Delete payment | No change | No change | **DELETE** payment journal | **received** | ✅ |
| 3 | Revert to confirmed | **-RESTORE inventory** | No change | - | confirmed | ✅ |
| 4 | Revert to sent | No change | **DELETE** invoice journal | - | sent | ✅ |
| 5 | Revert to draft | No change | No change | - | draft | ✅ |

**Trigger Behavior:**
- ✅ Payment deletion triggers recalculate → status reverts to 'received' (FIXED!)
- ✅ Reverting from 'received' restores inventory (removes stock)
- ✅ Reverting from 'confirmed' deletes invoice journal
- ✅ All operations are properly reversed

### 3. Prepayment Model Forward Flow

**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → Paid → Received

| Step | Action | Inventory | Journal | Payment Journal | Status | Verified |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create invoice (draft) | No change | No change | - | draft | ✅ |
| 2 | Mark as sent | No change | No change | - | sent | ✅ |
| 3 | Confirm invoice | No change | **CREATE** invoice journal | - | confirmed | ✅ |
| 4 | Register payment | No change | No change | **CREATE** payment journal | **paid** | ✅ |
| 5 | Mark as received | **+ADD inventory** | No change | - | received | ✅ |

**Trigger Behavior:**
- ✅ Payment moves status to 'paid' (BEFORE receiving goods)
- ✅ Inventory consumed ONLY at 'received' (step 5, AFTER payment)
- ✅ Invoice journal created ONCE at 'confirmed'
- ✅ Workflow respects prepayment model (pay first, receive later)

### 4. Prepayment Model Backward Flow

**Workflow**: Received → Paid → Confirmed → Sent → Draft

| Step | Action | Inventory | Journal | Payment Journal | Status | Verified |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Start at received | Inventory +10 | Invoice journal exists | Payment journal exists | received | ✅ |
| 2 | Delete payment | **-RESTORE inventory** | No change | **DELETE** payment journal | **confirmed** | ✅ |
| 3 | Revert to sent | No change | **DELETE** invoice journal | - | sent | ✅ |
| 4 | Revert to draft | No change | No change | - | draft | ✅ |

**Trigger Behavior:**
- ✅ Payment deletion triggers recalculate → status reverts to 'confirmed' (FIXED!)
- ✅ Status change from 'received' to 'confirmed' triggers inventory restore
- ✅ Invoice journal stays until reverting to sent (liability still exists)
- ✅ Prepayment model backward flow works correctly

## 🔍 EDGE CASES VERIFIED

### Edge Case 1: Edit Invoice Items at 'Received' Status

**Scenario**: Invoice at 'received' with Product A (qty 10), edit to Product A (qty 5)

| Event | Action | Inventory Change | Verified |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | Initial state | Inventory +10 (already added) | ✅ |
| 2 | UPDATE invoice items | Trigger fires: restore OLD (-10), consume NEW (+5) | ✅ |
| 3 | Net inventory change | -10 + 5 = **-5** (correct reduction) | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ Inventory correctly adjusted when items edited at 'received' status

### Edge Case 2: Edit Invoice Amounts at 'Confirmed' Status

**Scenario**: Invoice at 'confirmed' with $1,000 total, edit to $1,500 total

| Event | Action | Journal Entry | Verified |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Initial state | Journal entry exists (Dr Inventory $1,000 / Cr AP $1,000) | ✅ |
| 2 | UPDATE invoice amounts | Trigger checks: OLD.total != NEW.total → recreate journal | ✅ |
| 3 | New journal entry | Journal deleted and recreated (Dr Inventory $1,500 / Cr AP $1,500) | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ Journal entry correctly recreated when amounts change at same status

### Edge Case 3: Delete Invoice at 'Received' Status

**Scenario**: Invoice at 'received' with inventory already added

| Event | Action | Cleanup | Verified |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | DELETE invoice | Trigger fires DELETE event | ✅ |
| 2 | Inventory cleanup | restore_purchase_invoice_inventory(OLD) → inventory restored | ✅ |
| 3 | Journal cleanup | delete_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(OLD.id) → journal deleted | ✅ |
| 4 | Stock movements | Stock movements automatically deleted by restore function | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ All cleanup operations performed correctly when invoice deleted

### Edge Case 4: Partial Payment Deletion

**Standard Model**:
- Invoice at 'paid' with 2 payments ($600 + $400 = $1,000)
- Delete $400 payment
- Recalculate: v_total = $600, invoice.total = $1,000
- Logic: `v_total > 0 AND status IN ('received', 'paid')` → status = 'received' ✅

**Prepayment Model**:
- Invoice at 'received' with 2 payments ($600 + $400 = $1,000)
- Delete $400 payment
- Recalculate: v_total = $600, invoice.total = $1,000
- Logic: `v_total > 0 AND status IN ('paid', 'received')` → status = 'paid' ✅

**Result**: ✅ Partial payment deletion handled correctly for both models

### Edge Case 5: Manual Status Jump (Received → Draft)

**Scenario**: Admin manually changes status from 'received' to 'draft' (bypassing workflow)

| Event | Action | Cleanup | Verified |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | UPDATE status to 'draft' | Trigger fires | ✅ |
| 2 | Inventory | v_old_status = 'received', v_new_status = 'draft' → restore inventory | ✅ |
| 3 | Journal | v_old_status IN ('confirmed', 'received', 'paid'), v_new_status = 'draft' → delete journal | ✅ |
| 4 | Recalculate | status = 'draft', stays as 'draft' (pre-confirmation status) | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ Manual status jumps handled correctly (all cleanup performed)

⚠️ **Note**: If payments exist, UI should prevent reverting to draft until payments deleted. This is a workflow constraint, not a trigger bug.

## 🔄 TRIGGER INTERACTION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Payment Deletion → Invoice Update

1. **Payment DELETE trigger fires**:
   - delete_purchase_payment_journal_entry(OLD.id)
   - recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments(OLD.invoice_id)

2. **Recalculate function**:
   - Calculates new status based on v_total and prepayment_model
   - Updates invoice status (e.g., 'paid' → 'received')

3. **Invoice UPDATE trigger fires**:
   - Detects status change
   - Performs inventory/journal cleanup as needed
   - Calls recalculate again (redundant but harmless)

**Verified**: ✅ No infinite loops (second recalculate produces same result, no further changes)

### Pattern 2: Invoice Status Update → Recalculate

1. **User manually updates status** (e.g., 'received' → 'confirmed')

2. **Invoice UPDATE trigger fires**:
   - Performs inventory/journal operations based on status change
   - Calls recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments(NEW.id)

3. **Recalculate function**:
   - Checks if status matches payment amount
   - Usually no change needed (manual status is intentional)

**Verified**: ✅ Manual status updates work correctly, recalculate doesn't interfere

### Pattern 3: Invoice Amount Update → Journal Recreate

1. **User edits invoice amounts** (e.g., $1,000 → $1,500) at 'confirmed' status

2. **Invoice UPDATE trigger fires**:
   - OLD.status = NEW.status = 'confirmed' (same)
   - Checks: OLD.subtotal != NEW.subtotal → TRUE
   - Action: delete OLD journal + create NEW journal

**Verified**: ✅ Journal entry correctly recreated when amounts change

## 🎯 BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFICATION

### Invoice Journal Entry (Created at 'Confirmed')

**Purpose**: Record purchase liability  
**Entry**: Dr 1510 Inventory / Cr 2110 Accounts Payable  
**Created**: When status reaches 'confirmed'  
**Deleted**: When status reverts to 'draft'/'sent'/'cancelled'  
**Recreated**: ONLY if amounts change at same status  
**Stays intact**: When moving between confirmed/received/paid

**Verified**: ✅ Journal entry behavior correct for both models

### Payment Journal Entry (Created with Payment)

**Purpose**: Record payment of liability  
**Entry**: Dr 2110 Accounts Payable / Cr 1101/1110 Bank/Cash  
**Created**: When payment registered  
**Deleted**: When payment deleted  
**Independent**: From invoice status changes

**Verified**: ✅ Payment journal entry correctly managed by payment trigger

### Inventory Movements (Only at 'Received')

**Purpose**: Record physical stock arrival  
**Action**: Increase inventory_qty + create stock_movement (type='IN')  
**Triggered**: ONLY when status = 'received'  
**Restored**: When status leaves 'received'  
**Model-agnostic**: Same for both prepayment models

**Verified**: ✅ Inventory ONLY changes at 'received' status (both models)

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Comprehensive Review Found:
- ✅ All 3 critical bugs have been fixed
- ✅ Forward and backward flows work correctly
- ✅ Trigger interactions are sound (no infinite loops)
- ✅ Prepayment models handled correctly
- ✅ Edge cases properly handled
- ✅ Cleanup operations complete

### What Makes Logic Correct:
1. **Inventory**: Explicit check for 'received' status (both directions)
2. **Journal**: Explicit check for status range transitions
3. **Payment Recalc**: Checks prepayment_model flag and current status
4. **Triggers**: Use OLD and NEW correctly for cleanup operations
5. **Idempotency**: Redundant recalculate calls produce same result

### Prevention Strategy:
1. ✅ Always trace BOTH forward and backward flows
2. ✅ Always check ALL status transitions (not just happy path)
3. ✅ Always verify prepayment model differences
4. ✅ Always test edge cases (manual status changes, partial payments)
5. ✅ Always check for duplicate operations
