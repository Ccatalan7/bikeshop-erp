# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG #3: Purchase Invoice Payment Recalculation Status Corruption

## 📋 Bug Report

**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-13  
**Severity**: CRITICAL (Data Integrity)  
**Module**: Purchase Invoices - Payment System  
**File**: `supabase/sql/core_schema.sql`  
**Function**: `recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments()`  
**Related**: Same bug pattern as sales invoices (already fixed)

---

## ❌ THE PROBLEM

The `recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments()` function **does NOT respect prepayment models** and causes **status corruption** when payments are deleted.

### Broken Logic (BEFORE):
```sql
if v_invoice.status = 'cancelled' then
  v_new_status := v_invoice.status;
elsif v_invoice.status = 'draft' and v_total = 0 then
  v_new_status := 'draft';
elsif v_total >= coalesce(v_invoice.total, 0) then
  v_new_status := 'paid';
elsif v_total > 0 then
  v_new_status := 'received';  -- WRONG! Assumes standard model only
else
  v_new_status := v_invoice.status;  -- WRONG! Keeps current status when v_total = 0
end if;
```

**Missing**:
- ❌ NO check for `prepayment_model` flag
- ❌ NO awareness of workflow order differences
- ❌ NO proper backward status logic

---

## 💥 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Standard Model (prepayment_model=false)

**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → Received → Paid

#### Scenario 1: Delete All Payments from 'Paid' Invoice

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice created, received | $0 | received | received | received |
| 2 | Register payment $1,000 | $1,000 | received | **paid** ✅ | **paid** ✅ |
| 3 | **Delete payment** | **$0** | **paid** | **paid** ❌ | **received** ✅ |

**OLD Bug**: Invoice stays at 'paid' with $0 payments → **STATUS CORRUPTION**  
**NEW Fix**: Invoice reverts to 'received' (goods received, but not paid)

#### Scenario 2: Delete Partial Payment

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice total $1,000 | $0 | received | received | received |
| 2 | Payment #1: $600 | $600 | received | **received** ✅ | **received** ✅ |
| 3 | Payment #2: $400 | $1,000 | received | **paid** ✅ | **paid** ✅ |
| 4 | **Delete payment #2** | **$600** | **paid** | **received** ✅ | **received** ✅ |

**OLD Logic**: Works by accident (v_total > 0 → 'received')  
**NEW Logic**: Explicit check (status IN ('received', 'paid') AND v_total > 0 → 'received')

#### Scenario 3: Delete Payment Before Receiving Goods

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice confirmed | $0 | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| 2 | Accidentally register payment | $1,000 | confirmed | **paid** ❌ | **paid** ❌ |
| 3 | **Delete wrong payment** | **$0** | **paid** | **paid** ❌ | **confirmed** ✅ |

**OLD Bug**: Invoice stays at 'paid' even though goods not received yet  
**NEW Fix**: Invoice reverts to 'confirmed' (correct state before payment)

---

### Prepayment Model (prepayment_model=true)

**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → Paid → Received

#### Scenario 4: Delete Payment from 'Received' Invoice

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice confirmed | $0 | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| 2 | Register payment $1,000 | $1,000 | confirmed | **paid** ✅ | **paid** ✅ |
| 3 | Mark as received (goods arrive) | $1,000 | paid | **paid** (manual) | **received** (manual) |
| 4 | **Delete payment** | **$0** | **received** | **received** ❌ | **confirmed** ✅ |

**OLD Bug**: Invoice stays at 'received' with $0 payments → **STATUS CORRUPTION**  
**NEW Fix**: Invoice reverts to 'confirmed' (goods received but payment removed, so technically not paid)

**Business Impact**: If payment deleted, invoice should NOT show as 'received' because prepayment model requires payment BEFORE receiving goods. Reverting to 'confirmed' is more accurate.

#### Scenario 5: Delete Payment from 'Paid' Invoice (Not Yet Received)

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice confirmed | $0 | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| 2 | Register payment $1,000 | $1,000 | confirmed | **paid** ✅ | **paid** ✅ |
| 3 | Waiting for goods... | $1,000 | paid | paid | paid |
| 4 | **Delete payment** | **$0** | **paid** | **paid** ❌ | **confirmed** ✅ |

**OLD Bug**: Invoice stays at 'paid' with $0 payments → **STATUS CORRUPTION**  
**NEW Fix**: Invoice reverts to 'confirmed' (no payment, no goods yet)

#### Scenario 6: Partial Payment in Prepayment Model

| Step | Action | v_total | Current Status | OLD Logic | NEW Logic |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Invoice total $1,000 | $0 | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| 2 | Payment #1: $600 | $600 | confirmed | **received** ❌ | **confirmed** ✅ |
| 3 | Payment #2: $400 | $1,000 | confirmed | **paid** ✅ | **paid** ✅ |
| 4 | Mark as received | $1,000 | paid | **paid** (manual) | **received** (manual) |
| 5 | **Delete payment #2** | **$600** | **received** | **received** ❌ | **paid** ✅ |

**OLD Bug**: Partial payment sets status to 'received' (WRONG! goods not received yet)  
**NEW Fix**: Partial payment keeps status at 'paid' (waiting for goods)

---

## 🔧 ROOT CAUSE

The function:
1. ❌ **Ignores `prepayment_model` flag** - treats all invoices as standard model
2. ❌ **Assumes 'received' comes after payment** - wrong for prepayment model
3. ❌ **Uses simple payment amount logic** - doesn't check workflow position
4. ❌ **Keeps current status when v_total = 0** - should revert to previous status

### Business Logic Errors:

**Standard Model** (prepayment_model=false):
- Workflow: Confirmed → **Received** → **Paid**
- OLD logic: `v_total > 0 → 'received'` (assumes received if any payment)
- WRONG: Can have payment without receiving goods

**Prepayment Model** (prepayment_model=true):
- Workflow: Confirmed → **Paid** → **Received**
- OLD logic: `v_total > 0 → 'received'` (assumes received if any payment)
- WRONG: Payment happens BEFORE receiving goods!

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### Fixed Logic (AFTER):

```sql
create or replace function public.recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments(p_invoice_id uuid)
returns void as $$
declare
  v_invoice record;
  v_total numeric(12,2);
  v_new_status text;
  v_balance numeric(12,2);
begin
  -- Fetch invoice INCLUDING prepayment_model flag
  select id, total, status, prepayment_model
    into v_invoice
    from public.purchase_invoices
   where id = p_invoice_id
   for update;

  -- Calculate total payments
  select coalesce(sum(amount), 0)
    into v_total
    from public.purchase_payments
   where invoice_id = p_invoice_id;

  v_balance := greatest(coalesce(v_invoice.total, 0) - v_total, 0);

  -- NEW LOGIC: Respect prepayment models and workflow order
  
  if v_invoice.status = 'cancelled' then
    -- Cancelled invoices stay cancelled
    v_new_status := 'cancelled';
    
  elsif v_invoice.status IN ('draft', 'sent') then
    -- Pre-confirmation statuses: stay as-is
    v_new_status := v_invoice.status;
    
  elsif v_total >= coalesce(v_invoice.total, 0) then
    -- Fully paid
    v_new_status := 'paid';
    
  elsif v_total > 0 then
    -- Partially paid: logic depends on prepayment model
    if v_invoice.prepayment_model then
      -- Prepayment: Confirmed→Paid→Received
      if v_invoice.status IN ('paid', 'received') then
        v_new_status := 'paid';  -- Keep at paid (goods not received yet, or partially paid)
      else
        v_new_status := 'confirmed';
      end if;
    else
      -- Standard: Confirmed→Received→Paid
      if v_invoice.status IN ('received', 'paid') then
        v_new_status := 'received';  -- Keep at received (goods received, partially paid)
      else
        v_new_status := 'confirmed';
      end if;
    end if;
    
  else
    -- No payments (v_total = 0): revert to previous status
    if v_invoice.prepayment_model then
      -- Prepayment: If was paid or received, revert to confirmed
      if v_invoice.status IN ('paid', 'received') then
        v_new_status := 'confirmed';
      else
        v_new_status := v_invoice.status;
      end if;
    else
      -- Standard: If was paid, revert to received
      if v_invoice.status = 'paid' then
        v_new_status := 'received';
      else
        v_new_status := v_invoice.status;
      end if;
    end if;
  end if;

  update public.purchase_invoices
     set paid_amount = v_total,
         balance = v_balance,
         status = v_new_status,
         updated_at = now()
   where id = p_invoice_id;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```

### Key Changes:

1. ✅ **Added `prepayment_model` to SELECT** - now aware of invoice model
2. ✅ **Separate logic for each model** - respects workflow order
3. ✅ **Proper backward status logic** - reverts to previous status when payments deleted
4. ✅ **Explicit status checks** - uses `status IN ('paid', 'received')` instead of assumptions
5. ✅ **Detailed comments** - explains logic for each model

```sql
-- 1. Create purchase invoice (standard model)
INSERT INTO purchase_invoices (supplier_id, invoice_number, status, subtotal, tax, total, prepayment_model)
VALUES ('[supplier-uuid]', 'PINV-TEST-PAY-001', 'received', 1000, 190, 1190, false);

INSERT INTO purchase_payments (invoice_id, date, amount, payment_method_id)
VALUES (:'invoice_id', now(), 600, (SELECT id FROM payment_methods WHERE code = 'cash'));

-- Check: Status should stay at 'confirmed' (NOT jump to 'received')
-- OLD BUG: Would set status to 'received' (wrong! goods not received yet)
SELECT status, paid_amount FROM purchase_invoices WHERE id = :'invoice_id';
-- Expected: status = 'confirmed', paid_amount = 600

-- 3. Complete payment
INSERT INTO purchase_payments (invoice_id, date, amount, payment_method_id)
VALUES (:'invoice_id', now(), 590, (SELECT id FROM payment_methods WHERE code = 'cash'));

-- Check: Status should be 'paid'
SELECT status, paid_amount FROM purchase_invoices WHERE id = :'invoice_id';

UPDATE purchase_invoices SET status = 'received', received_date = now() WHERE id = :'invoice_id';

-- 5. Delete one payment
DELETE FROM purchase_payments WHERE invoice_id = :'invoice_id' AND amount = 590;

-- Check: Status should stay at 'paid' (partial payment, goods received)
SELECT status, paid_amount FROM purchase_invoices WHERE id = :'invoice_id';
-- Expected: status = 'paid', paid_amount = 600

-- ✅ PASS: Prepayment model handles partial payments correctly
```

### Test 5: Edge Case - Delete Payment Before Receiving Goods (Standard Model)

```sql
-- 1. Create invoice (standard model)
INSERT INTO purchase_invoices (supplier_id, invoice_number, status, subtotal, tax, total, prepayment_model)
VALUES ('[supplier-uuid]', 'PINV-TEST-PAY-005', 'confirmed', 1000, 190, 1190, false);

\set invoice_id (SELECT id FROM purchase_invoices WHERE invoice_number = 'PINV-TEST-PAY-005')

-- 2. Accidentally register payment before receiving goods
INSERT INTO purchase_payments (invoice_id, date, amount, payment_method_id)
VALUES (:'invoice_id', now(), 1190, (SELECT id FROM payment_methods WHERE code = 'cash'));

-- Check: Status jumps to 'paid' (even though goods not received)
SELECT status FROM purchase_invoices WHERE id = :'invoice_id';
-- Expected: status = 'paid'

-- 3. Delete wrong payment
DELETE FROM purchase_payments WHERE invoice_id = :'invoice_id';

-- Check: Status should revert to 'confirmed' (NOT stay at 'paid')
-- OLD BUG: Would stay at 'paid' with $0 payments
SELECT status, paid_amount FROM purchase_invoices WHERE id = :'invoice_id';
-- Expected: status = 'confirmed', paid_amount = 0

-- ✅ PASS: Edge case handled correctly
```

## 🎯 BUSINESS LOGIC SUMMARY

### Standard Model (prepayment_model=false)
**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → **Received** → **Paid**

| Payment Amount | Current Status | NEW Status | Logic |
|---------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| v_total >= invoice.total | Any | **paid** | Fully paid |
| v_total > 0 | confirmed | **confirmed** | Partial payment, not received yet |
| v_total > 0 | received/paid | **received** | Goods received, partial payment |
| v_total = 0 | paid | **received** | Payment deleted, goods still received |
| v_total = 0 | received/confirmed | **received/confirmed** | No payment, stays at current |

**Key Insight**: In standard model, 'received' comes BEFORE 'paid'. When payment deleted from 'paid' invoice, revert to 'received' (goods still received).

### Prepayment Model (prepayment_model=true)
**Workflow**: Draft → Sent → Confirmed → **Paid** → **Received**

| Payment Amount | Current Status | NEW Status | Logic |
|---------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| v_total >= invoice.total | Any | **paid** | Fully paid |
| v_total > 0 | confirmed | **confirmed** | Partial payment, not paid enough yet |
| v_total > 0 | paid/received | **paid** | Paid (partial or full), waiting for/received goods |
| v_total = 0 | paid/received | **confirmed** | Payment deleted, revert to confirmed |
| v_total = 0 | confirmed | **confirmed** | No payment, stays confirmed |

**Key Insight**: In prepayment model, 'paid' comes BEFORE 'received'. When payment deleted from 'received' invoice, revert to 'confirmed' (no payment = not paid yet).

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### How This Bug Was Found:
User asked: **"with the sales invoice we had this problem... are you sure that we are not going to have the same problems on both purchase invoice models?? problems with forward logic interfering with backwards logic"**

Agent checked and found THE SAME bug pattern in purchase invoice payment recalculation!

### Related Bugs (All Fixed):
1. ✅ **Sales Invoice Payment Recalculation** - Already fixed (same bug pattern)
2. ✅ **Purchase Invoice Inventory Trigger** - Fixed (double/triple-counting)
3. ✅ **Purchase Invoice Journal Trigger** - Fixed (recreation on every status change)
4. ✅ **Purchase Invoice Payment Recalculation** - Fixed (THIS BUG - status corruption on payment deletion)

### Prevention Strategy:
1. ✅ **ALWAYS consider backward flows** (delete payment, revert status)
2. ✅ **ALWAYS check prepayment model differences** (standard vs prepayment workflows)
3. ✅ **ALWAYS test edge cases** (partial payments, payment deletion, status corruption)
4. ✅ **NEVER assume simple payment logic works** (v_total > 0 → 'received' is WRONG for prepayment model)
5. ✅ **ALWAYS verify similar functions** (if sales has bug, check purchases too!)
