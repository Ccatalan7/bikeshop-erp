## 🚀 How to Deploy the Mobile App

### Step 1: Create Flutter Project

```bash
cd /Users/Claudio/Dev
flutter create vinabike_scanner
cd vinabike_scanner
```

### Step 2: Copy Template Files

```bash
# Copy all files from template
cp -r ~/Dev/bikeshop-erp/mobile_scanner_app/lib/* lib/
cp ~/Dev/bikeshop-erp/mobile_scanner_app/pubspec.yaml pubspec.yaml
```

### Step 3: Configure Supabase

Edit `lib/main.dart` and replace:

```dart
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',  // ← From your main ERP
  anonKey: 'YOUR_ANON_KEY',  // ← From your main ERP
);
```

### Step 4: Add Platform Permissions

**Android** - Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
```

**iOS** - Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access to scan barcodes</string>
```

### Step 5: Install & Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run  # Connect your phone via USB or use wireless debugging
```

## 📖 How to Use

### On Windows ERP:

1. Go to **Configuración → Dispositivos → Escáner Remoto**
2. Click **"Iniciar"** to start listening
3. A **QR code** appears on screen
4. Keep this window open

### On Your Phone:

1. Launch **Vinabike Scanner** app
2. **Scan the QR code** shown on Windows
3. You'll see **"Dispositivo emparejado exitosamente"**
4. Start scanning barcodes!

### Scanned codes will:
- Appear instantly on Windows ERP
- Show in the "Escaneos recientes" list
- Trigger a notification snackbar
- Be routed to the target module (if selected)

---

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Module Targeting

On the mobile app, tap the **tune icon** (⚙️) to select a target module:
- **Todos (Auto)** - Let ERP decide where to route
- **🛒 POS** - Direct scans to Point of Sale
- **📦 Inventario** - Direct scans to Inventory
- **🧾 Ventas** - Direct scans to Sales
- **📥 Compras** - Direct scans to Purchases
- **🔧 Mantenimiento** - Direct scans to Maintenance

### Scan History

Tap the **history icon** (🕒) to view:
- Last 50 scans
- Timestamp for each scan
- Success/failure status
- Target module (if any)

### Multiple Devices

You can pair **multiple phones** to the same Windows ERP:
- Each phone has a unique device ID
- All scans appear in the Windows ERP's list
- Device name shows which phone sent the scan

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Added to Windows ERP:

```yaml
qr_flutter: ^4.1.0  # QR code generation
```

### Mobile App Dependencies:

```yaml
supabase_flutter: ^2.6.0      # Realtime communication
mobile_scanner: ^5.2.3        # Camera barcode scanning
provider: ^6.1.2              # State management
shared_preferences: ^2.2.3    # Device pairing storage
uuid: ^4.4.0                  # Device ID generation
intl: ^0.20.0                 # Date formatting
```

### Supabase Realtime Channel:

- **Channel Name**: `barcode_scans:{device_id}`
- **Event Type**: `scan`
- **Payload**: JSON with barcode, timestamp, device info, target module

### Security:

- No authentication required (uses Supabase anon key)
- Pairing via device ID prevents random scans
- Scans are broadcast (not stored in database)
- Row Level Security not needed (ephemeral data)

---

## 📱 Supported Barcode Formats

The mobile app supports:
- **QR Code**
- **EAN-8, EAN-13**
- **UPC-A, UPC-E**
- **Code 39, Code 93, Code 128**
- **ITF, Codabar**
- **PDF417, Aztec, Data Matrix**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Scans Not Appearing on Windows

**Check:**
- ✅ Both devices on same Supabase project (same URL/anon key)
- ✅ Windows ERP "Escáner Remoto" is **listening** (green status)
- ✅ QR code was scanned correctly
- ✅ Phone has internet connection

**Fix:**
- Unpair and re-pair the device
- Restart the Windows ERP listener
- Check browser console for errors

---

### Camera Not Working

**Check:**
- ✅ Camera permissions granted (phone settings)
- ✅ No other app using camera
- ✅ Good lighting conditions

**Fix:**
- Restart the app
- Clear app data
- Try on different device

---

### Duplicate Scans

The app **automatically prevents duplicates** within 2 seconds. If still seeing duplicates:
- Check if multiple phones are paired
- Ensure only one person is scanning
- Look at scan history to see device names

---

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Change App Theme:

Edit `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  primarySwatch: Colors.green,  // ← Change color
  useMaterial3: true,
),
```

### Change Duplicate Prevention Time:

Edit `lib/screens/scanner_screen.dart`:

```dart
Duration(seconds: 2)  // ← Change to 1, 3, 5, etc.
```

### Add Scan Sound:

Add `audioplayers` dependency and play sound on successful scan.

### Custom Vibration Pattern:

Replace `HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()` with:

```dart
HapticFeedback.vibrate();
```
