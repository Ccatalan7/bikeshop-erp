# üîß Pega ‚Üî Invoice Bi-Directional Sync Fix

## üö® Problem Identified

The Pega (mechanic_job) and Invoice (sales_invoices) relationship was **one-way only**:
- ‚úÖ Creating invoice from pega worked
- ‚ùå Changing invoice status ‚Üí Pega didn't update
- ‚ùå Modifying invoice items ‚Üí Pega items didn't sync
- ‚ùå Deleting invoice ‚Üí Pega still showed "invoiced"
- ‚ùå Adding/removing products in pega ‚Üí Invoice didn't update

**Root cause:** No database triggers to maintain the relationship when invoice changes!

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **New Database Functions in `core_schema.sql`:**

#### `sync_invoice_items_to_job(p_invoice_id)`
- **Purpose:** Syncs invoice items back to `mechanic_job_items`
- **When called:** Every time invoice is created or updated
- **What it does:**
  - Deletes old job items
  - Recreates them from invoice.items jsonb
  - Separates labor vs parts
  - Updates job costs (labor_cost, parts_cost, total_cost, tax_amount)

#### `sync_invoice_status_to_job(p_invoice_id)`
- **Purpose:** Syncs invoice status & payment to job flags
- **When called:** Every time invoice status or payments change
- **What it does:**
  - Updates `mechanic_jobs.is_paid` based on invoice.status = 'paid'
  - Updates `mechanic_jobs.is_invoiced` = true
  - Keeps pega UI in sync with invoice reality

#### `handle_invoice_deleted_for_job()`
- **Purpose:** Clears job reference when invoice is deleted
- **When called:** BEFORE invoice deletion (trigger)
- **What it does:**
  - Sets `mechanic_jobs.invoice_id` = null
  - Sets `is_invoiced` = false, `is_paid` = false
  - Allows creating a new invoice for the pega

### 2. **Updated Existing Functions:**

#### `handle_sales_invoice_change()`
**Added sync calls:**
```sql
-- After INSERT:
perform public.sync_invoice_items_to_job(NEW.id);
perform public.sync_invoice_status_to_job(NEW.id);

-- After UPDATE:
perform public.sync_invoice_items_to_job(NEW.id);
perform public.sync_invoice_status_to_job(NEW.id);
```

#### `recalculate_sales_invoice_payments()`
**Replaced manual update with sync function:**
```sql
-- OLD (manual update):
update mechanic_jobs set is_paid = ... where invoice_id = ...

-- NEW (uses sync function):
perform public.sync_invoice_status_to_job(p_invoice_id);
```

---

### 3. **New Trigger:**

```sql
create trigger trg_invoice_deleted_clear_job
  before delete on sales_invoices
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_invoice_deleted_for_job();
```

---

## üîÑ Complete Sync Flow

### **Pega ‚Üí Invoice (Already Working)**
1. User adds products/services to pega
2. Clicks "Create Invoice"
3. `create_invoice_from_mechanic_job()` runs
4. Invoice created with all items
5. `mechanic_jobs.invoice_id` is set

### **Invoice ‚Üí Pega (NOW FIXED!)**

#### **Invoice Status Changes:**
```
Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Paid
         ‚Üì         ‚Üì          ‚Üì
      Updates pega flags each time
```

Every status change:
1. `handle_sales_invoice_change()` trigger fires
2. Calls `sync_invoice_status_to_job()`
3. Updates `is_paid` flag in pega
4. Pega UI shows correct payment status

#### **Invoice Items Modified:**
```
Add product to invoice
    ‚Üì
Sync to mechanic_job_items
    ‚Üì
Pega details show new product
```

Every invoice update:
1. `handle_sales_invoice_change()` trigger fires
2. Calls `sync_invoice_items_to_job()`
3. Deletes old job items
4. Recreates from invoice.items
5. Recalculates costs (parts, labor, tax, total)

#### **Invoice Deleted:**
```
Delete invoice
    ‚Üì
Clear pega reference
    ‚Üì
User can create new invoice
```

Before deletion:
1. `trg_invoice_deleted_clear_job` trigger fires
2. Clears `mechanic_jobs.invoice_id`
3. Sets `is_invoiced = false`, `is_paid = false`
4. Pega shows "Crear" button again

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Status Flow Test**
1. Create pega with products
2. Create invoice (status = draft)

4. Change invoice to "Sent"
5. **Check:** Pega still shows link ‚úÖ
6. Change invoice to "Confirmed"
7. **Check:** Pega still shows link ‚úÖ
8. Add payment ‚Üí status = "Paid"
9. **Check:** Pega shows `is_paid = true` ‚úÖ

### **Scenario 2: Item Modification Test**
1. Create pega with 2 products
2. Create invoice
3. Go to invoice detail
4. Add 1 more product
5. **Check:** Pega details now show 3 products ‚úÖ
6. Remove 1 product from invoice
7. **Check:** Pega details now show 2 products ‚úÖ

### **Scenario 3: Invoice Deletion Test**
1. Create pega
2. Create invoice
3. Delete invoice
4. **Check:** Pega "Factura/Pago" column shows "Crear" button ‚úÖ
5. **Check:** Pega detail doesn't show invoice link ‚úÖ
6. Create new invoice
7. **Check:** New invoice links correctly ‚úÖ

### **Scenario 4: Payment Toggle Test**
1. Create pega ‚Üí invoice (draft)
2. Go back and forth: Draft ‚Üî Confirmed ‚Üî Paid
3. **Check:** Pega `is_paid` toggles correctly ‚úÖ
4. **Check:** Invoice link never breaks ‚úÖ

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### **To Deploy:**

1. **Stop any running instances** (optional but recommended)

2. **Deploy the updated `core_schema.sql`:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   -- Copy entire contents of supabase/sql/core_schema.sql
   -- Paste and execute
   ```

3. **Verify triggers created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table
   FROM information_schema.triggers
   WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%invoice%job%'
   ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
   ```

   **Expected output:**
   - `trg_invoice_deleted_clear_job` on `sales_invoices`

4. **Test the sync functions manually:**
   ```sql
   -- Test 1: Find a job with invoice
   SELECT id, job_number, invoice_id, is_paid
   FROM mechanic_jobs
   WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1;

   -- Test 2: Sync status
   SELECT sync_invoice_status_to_job('[invoice_id_from_above]');

   -- Test 3: Sync items
   SELECT sync_invoice_items_to_job('[invoice_id_from_above]');
   ```

5. **Test in the app:**
   - Create a test pega
   - Create invoice from it
   - Modify invoice status
   - Check pega updates
   - Modify invoice items
   - Check pega items update
   - Delete invoice
   - Check pega clears reference

---

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### **Check Sync Status:**
```sql
-- Find pegas with invoices
SELECT 
  mj.job_number,
  mj.invoice_id,
  mj.is_invoiced,
  mj.is_paid,
  si.invoice_number,
  si.status,
  si.total
FROM mechanic_jobs mj
LEFT JOIN sales_invoices si ON si.id = mj.invoice_id
WHERE mj.invoice_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Check for Orphaned References:**
```sql
-- Pegas pointing to deleted invoices
SELECT 
  mj.job_number,
  mj.invoice_id,
  mj.is_invoiced
FROM mechanic_jobs mj
WHERE mj.invoice_id IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sales_invoices si WHERE si.id = mj.invoice_id
  );
```

### **Verify Item Sync:**
```sql
-- Compare invoice items vs job items
SELECT 
  si.invoice_number,
  jsonb_array_length(si.items) as invoice_items_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mechanic_job_items WHERE job_id = mj.id) as job_items_count
FROM sales_invoices si
JOIN mechanic_jobs mj ON mj.invoice_id = si.id;
```

## üöÄ What's Next?

### **Recommended Enhancements:**

1. **Add validation:**
   - Prevent invoice deletion if pega status is "ENTREGADO"
   - Warn before unlinking invoice from pega

2. **Add audit trail:**
   - Log when sync functions run
   - Track item changes in timeline

3. **Add UI indicators:**
   - Show last sync timestamp
   - Visual indicator if data is out of sync

4. **Add sync button (manual):**
   - Allow user to force sync if needed
   - Useful for debugging

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Data Integrity:**
- Sync is **one-way**: Invoice ‚Üí Pega
- If you modify pega items directly in DB, invoice won't update automatically
- Always modify through the invoice UI for proper sync

### **Performance:**
- Sync functions run on EVERY invoice update
- For large invoices (50+ items), may cause slight delay
- Monitor performance in production

### **Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ùå None! All changes are additive
- ‚úÖ Existing data remains intact
- ‚úÖ Existing invoices will sync on next update

---

## üéâ Expected Outcomes

After deployment:

‚úÖ **Invoice status changes immediately reflect in pega**  
‚úÖ **Adding/removing products in invoice updates pega items**  
‚úÖ **Deleting invoice properly clears pega reference**  
‚úÖ **Payment status syncs correctly (is_paid flag)**  
‚úÖ **No more "ghost" invoice references**  
‚úÖ **Users can recreate invoices after deletion**  
‚úÖ **Costs stay in sync (parts_cost, labor_cost, total_cost)**  

---

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment  
**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (additive changes only)
