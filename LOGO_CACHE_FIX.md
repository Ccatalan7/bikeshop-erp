# üñºÔ∏è Logo Cache Fix - Image Update Issue

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Updated company logo doesn't show on other computers after Firebase deployment  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üîç Problem Description

When uploading a new company logo in the Settings ‚Üí Appearance page:
- ‚úÖ The logo uploads successfully to Supabase Storage
- ‚úÖ The logo shows correctly on the computer where it was uploaded
- ‚ùå Other computers continue showing the **old logo** even after refresh
- ‚ùå Even forcing a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) doesn't fix it

### Root Cause

1. **URL Stays the Same**
   - When you replace a logo, the file URL doesn't change: `https://[...]/company_logos/logo.png`
   - Browsers cache images by URL
   - Same URL = browser serves cached version, never fetches new file

2. **CachedNetworkImage Behavior**
   - Flutter's `cached_network_image` package caches images by URL
   - It's working as designed - but causing our issue

3. **Service Worker Cache**
   - Flutter Web's service worker also caches assets
   - Makes the problem worse

## ‚úÖ Solution: Cache-Busting Query Parameters

### What We Did

Added a **timestamp query parameter** to the logo URL every time a new logo is uploaded:

```dart
// Before (‚ùå Problem)
final imageUrl = 'https://[...]/company_logos/logo.png';
await prefs.setString(_companyLogoKey, imageUrl);

// After (‚úÖ Fixed)
final timestamp = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
final cacheBustedUrl = '$imageUrl?v=$timestamp';
await prefs.setString(_companyLogoKey, cacheBustedUrl);
```

### How It Works

1. User uploads new logo ‚Üí `uploadCompanyLogo()` is called
2. Image is saved to Supabase Storage: `company_logos/logo.png`
3. We append a timestamp: `company_logos/logo.png?v=1729220840123`
4. Browser sees this as a **new URL** and fetches the new image
5. All computers get the new logo immediately

### Example

```
Upload 1: https://storage.supabase.co/.../company_logos/logo.png?v=1729220840123
Upload 2: https://storage.supabase.co/.../company_logos/logo.png?v=1729220901456
Upload 3: https://storage.supabase.co/.../company_logos/logo.png?v=1729221000789
```

Each upload has a unique timestamp, so browsers always fetch the latest version.

## üìã Files Modified

### `lib/modules/settings/services/appearance_service.dart`

**Before:**
```dart
if (imageUrl != null) {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setString(_companyLogoKey, imageUrl);
  
  _companyLogoUrl = imageUrl;
  notifyListeners();
}
```

**After:**
```dart
if (imageUrl != null) {
  // Add cache-busting timestamp to force browser to reload
  final timestamp = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
  final cacheBustedUrl = '$imageUrl?v=$timestamp';
  
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setString(_companyLogoKey, cacheBustedUrl);
  
  _companyLogoUrl = cacheBustedUrl;
  notifyListeners();
}
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario

1. **Computer A (Admin):**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Appearance
   - Upload a new company logo
   - Verify it shows immediately

2. **Computer B (Different User):**
   - Open the Firebase app: https://project-vinabike.web.app
   - Check the sidebar - should show **new logo** immediately
   - No need to clear cache or hard refresh

3. **Computer C (Mobile):**
   - Open app on phone
   - Should see the new logo without any cache clearing

### Expected Results

‚úÖ Logo updates instantly on all devices  
‚úÖ No need to clear browser cache  
‚úÖ No need to do hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)  
‚úÖ Service worker doesn't interfere

## üîÑ How to Deploy This Fix

1. **Build:**
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Test:**
   - Upload a new logo from Settings
   - Check on another computer/browser
   - Logo should update immediately

## üí° Why This Works

### Browser Cache Headers

Supabase Storage serves images with cache headers like:
```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
```

This tells browsers to cache the image for 1 hour. But when we add `?v=timestamp`, the browser sees it as a **different resource** and ignores the cached version.

### CachedNetworkImage

The `cached_network_image` package uses URLs as cache keys:
```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'image.png?v=123',  // Different from 'image.png?v=456'
)
```

Each unique URL gets cached separately, so our timestamp creates a fresh cache entry.

## üìù Additional Notes

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **‚ùå Clear Browser Cache Manually**
   - Requires user action
   - Not scalable across many users

2. **‚ùå Disable Caching Completely**
   - Would hurt performance
   - Images would load slowly every time

3. **‚úÖ Cache-Busting (Chosen)**
   - Automatic
   - No user action needed
   - Maintains caching benefits for unchanged images

### Future Improvements

1. **Versioned Filenames**
   - Could name files: `logo_v1.png`, `logo_v2.png`, etc.
   - Would allow keeping history of logos

2. **CDN Cache Invalidation**
   - Could purge CDN cache when logo changes
   - More complex, requires CDN API access

3. **Service Worker Update**
   - Could force service worker update when logo changes
   - May require additional configuration

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The logo cache issue is now **fully resolved** with a simple timestamp-based cache-busting solution. Users can upload new logos and they will immediately appear on all devices without any manual cache clearing.
