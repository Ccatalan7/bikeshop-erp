# Canonical UI Surface Registry

**Purpose:** prevent business actions from being implemented on an unrouted,
obsolete, or partial UI while the screen employees actually use remains
unchanged.

## Required Rule

A business workflow is not UI-complete until the same shared action is present
on every registered surface where the underlying document can be operated.
Routes, list previews, embedded editors, side panels, quick actions, and mobile
layouts are separate surfaces even when they display the same record.

- Put business behavior in a shared service/widget; surfaces only compose it.
- Do not retain competing `*_old.dart` or unrouted detail/list pages. Git history
  is the archive.
- Before editing UI, trace the real route in `app_router.dart`, its barrel
  export, and every constructor reference with `rg`.
- After editing, verify the employee's normal click path, not only a direct URL
  or isolated widget test.
- Critical workflows require an architecture test that asserts every registered
  surface consumes the shared action and obsolete competitors stay absent.

## Current Invoice Surfaces

| Document | User entry point | Canonical implementation | Required shared workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales invoice list/preview | `/sales/invoices` | `invoice_list_page.dart` (`_buildInvoicePreview` / `_buildActionBar`) | `SalesCorrectionsMenu` |
| Sales invoice full page | `/sales/invoices/:id`, `/sales/invoices/:id/edit` | `invoice_form_page.dart` | `SalesCorrectionsMenu` |
| Sales invoice embedded editor | Workshop/calendar/side-panel embeddings | `sales_invoice_editor.dart` | `SalesCorrectionsMenu` |
| Sales invoice payment | `/sales/invoices/:id/payment` and preview payment terminal | `invoice_payment_page.dart` / `PaymentForm` | Atomic sales payment command |
| Purchase invoice list | `/purchases` | `purchase_invoice_list_page.dart` | Navigation to canonical form/workflows |
| Purchase invoice full page | `/purchases/:id`, `/purchases/:id/detail`, `/purchases/:id/edit` | `purchase_invoice_form_page.dart` | Receiving, supplier return, purchase credit note |

`SalesCorrectionsMenu` applies Viñabike's operating policy consistently:

- `sent`: no correction;
- `confirmed` / `overdue`: financial credit note only;
- `paid`: financial credit note and physical customer return.

## Change Checklist

1. Identify all routes and constructor references for the business entity.
2. Update this table if any user entry point or implementation changed.
3. Implement the action once as a reusable component/service.
4. Compose it into every applicable surface and responsive variant.
5. Add/update widget tests for status/permission visibility.
6. Add/update the architecture guard for surface coverage and dead-page absence.
7. Build the supported desktop/web targets.
8. After deployment, sign in and verify the normal employee click path.
