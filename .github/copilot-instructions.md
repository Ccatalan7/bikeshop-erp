# 🧠 Project Overview

This is a modular ERP-style app for managing a bikeshop. It includes accounting, inventory, POS, customer management, maintenance tracking, HR, website builder, marketing, and analytics. The app is built in **Flutter/Dart**, targeting **Windows, Android, Web**, and optionally macOS/iOS.

The backend uses **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase or Railway) and **Firebase Auth** with **OAuth2** for secure login. All business logic must be accounting-first, with audit-ready data structures.

# 🧱 Modular Architecture

Each module is independent but shares a unified data layer. Modules include:

- **Sales**: Invoices, payments, discounts
- **Purchases**: Purchase orders, supplier credits, receipts
- **Inventory**: Products, stock movements, warehouses
- **Maintenance**: Work orders, parts used, labor cost
- **CRM**: Customer profiles, bike history, loyalty
- **Accounting**: Chart of accounts, journal entries, tax rules
- **HR (RRHH)**: Employees, contracts, attendance, payroll, planning
- **Website Builder**: Product catalog, online orders, CMS
- **Marketing**: Campaigns, email/SMS, customer segmentation
- **Analytics**: Dashboards, KPIs, sales trends, inventory turnover
- **Settings**: Company info, currency, theme, language, timezone

# 🔗 Integration Logic

- Online orders from Website Builder deduct inventory and generate invoices
- Marketing campaigns use CRM data and feed into Analytics
- POS, Website, and Maintenance all sync with Inventory and Accounting
- HR data (attendance, payroll) flows into Accounting
- Analytics pulls from all modules for unified dashboards

# 🧮 Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

Use normalized tables with foreign keys and constraints. Example:

`sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  sku TEXT UNIQUE,
  price NUMERIC,
  cost NUMERIC,
  inventory_qty INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
  source TEXT CHECK (source IN ('POS', 'Website')),
  date TIMESTAMP,
  total NUMERIC
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
  product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
  quantity INTEGER,
  price NUMERIC
);
`

Use triggers or service logic to update inventory and accounting entries.

# 🔐 Authentication

Use Firebase Auth with OAuth2 (Google, GitHub, etc.) for secure login. Support:

- Email/password
- Social login
- Role-based access control
- Token expiration and refresh

---

# 🧭 Navigation Design Rules

- Use minimalistic menu structure with one entry per module
- Avoid redundant submenus like “New Purchase Invoice”
- Use in-page navigation for actions (e.g., “+ New Invoice” button)
- Maintain consistent drawer/sidebar layout across all modules
- Use local routing (Navigator.push, GoRouter) for transitions
- Role-based menu visibility (admin, cashier, mechanic, accountant)

---

# 🎨 GUI Design System

Use a unified widget set across all screens:

- Buttons: consistent style (primary, secondary, danger)
- Forms: reusable components with validation
- Lists: paginated, searchable, filterable
- Modals: consistent layout and behavior
- Icons: use Material Icons or custom SVGs

Support:

- Dark mode toggle (global)
- Language selector (i18n)
- Time zone sync (auto-detect or manual)

---

# 🌍 Localization & Regional Context

App is primarily used in Chile

- Currency: CLP (Chilean Peso)
- Tax: IVA (19%), applied to invoices and purchases
- Language: Spanish (default), English (optional)
- Date format: DD/MM/YYYY
- Time zone: America/Santiago

---

# 👥 HR & Workforce Management (RRHH)

Include the following modules:

- Employees: personal data, job title, department
- Contracts: salary, working hours, legal terms
- Attendance: clock-in/out, calendar view, kiosk mode
- Payroll: salary computation, tax, payment status
- Planning: shift scheduling, technician availability
- Leaves: vacation, sick leave, approval workflows
- Timesheets: logged hours per task/project
- Roles & Permissions: access control per module

---

# 🌐 Website Builder

- Product catalog with images, descriptions, prices
- Online orders sync with Inventory and Accounting
- CMS for homepage, blog, promotions
- Customer login and order history
- Payment gateway integration (free-tier or mock)

---

# 📣 Marketing Module

- Campaign builder (email, SMS, push)
- Customer segmentation based on CRM data
- Promotion rules (discounts, bundles)
- Scheduled and triggered campaigns
- Integration with Analytics for performance tracking

---

# 📊 Analytics Dashboard

- Sales by product/category/date
- Inventory turnover and valuation
- Customer lifetime value
- Maintenance cost breakdown
- HR metrics (attendance, payroll trends)
- Campaign performance (open rate, conversion)

`

Each module:

- Has its own routes (GoRouter)
- Uses shared models (e.g. Product, Order, Customer, Employee)
- Follows the same UI design system

---

# 🧠 Copilot Expectations

Copilot must:

- Maintain consistent naming across modules
- Reuse shared models and widgets
- Respect business rules (e.g. inventory deduction, tax calculation)
- Avoid GUI fragmentation (no random button styles)
- Handle dark mode, language, and time zone globally
- Generate audit-ready accounting logic
- Use PostgreSQL syntax and constraints
- Avoid hardcoded values—use config or constants
- Use modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
