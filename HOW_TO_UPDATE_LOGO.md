## üîß What Was Fixed

### Before (‚ùå Problem)
- Logo would update on the computer where you uploaded it
- Other computers kept showing the old logo
- Even hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) didn't help

### After (‚úÖ Fixed)
- Logo updates **instantly** on all devices
- Browser cache is automatically handled
- No manual intervention needed

### How It Works
We now add a unique timestamp to each logo URL:
```
Old: company_logos/logo.png
New: company_logos/logo.png?v=1729220840123
```

Each upload gets a new timestamp, so browsers treat it as a new image.

## üì± Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open app on different computer - logo updates
- [ ] Open app on phone - logo updates
- [ ] Open app in different browser - logo updates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Updating?

1. **Make sure you're on the latest version**
   - Check URL: https://project-vinabike.web.app
   - Deployed: October 17, 2025 at 20:43

2. **Try a hard refresh (just once)**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - This loads the latest app code

3. **Check if upload succeeded**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Appearance
   - You should see the new logo in the preview
   - If not, try uploading again

4. **Mobile devices**
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Or reload the browser tab

### Still Having Issues?

- Clear browser cache completely (as last resort)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify you're logged in with the right account
- Make sure image file is valid (PNG, JPG, max 5MB)

## üìù Technical Details

For developers/admins who want to understand the fix:

### What Was Changed

**File:** `lib/modules/settings/services/appearance_service.dart`

**Change:** Added timestamp query parameter to logo URLs

```dart
// Add cache-busting timestamp
final timestamp = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
final cacheBustedUrl = '$imageUrl?v=$timestamp';
```

### Why It Works

1. **Browser caches images by URL**
   - Same URL = cached version
   - Different URL = fetch new version

2. **Timestamp makes URL unique**
   - Every upload gets a new timestamp
   - Browser sees each as a different resource

3. **No performance impact**
   - Images are still cached (good for performance)
   - Only new logos trigger fresh downloads

### Deployment Info

- **Build time:** Oct 17, 2025 at 20:43
- **File size:** 3.9M (main.dart.js)
- **Deploy method:** `firebase deploy --only hosting`
- **Live URL:** https://project-vinabike.web.app

## ‚úÖ Summary

Logo updates now work correctly across all devices thanks to automatic cache-busting. Just upload your new logo in Settings ‚Üí Appearance and it will appear everywhere immediately!
