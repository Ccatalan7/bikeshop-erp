# Comprehensive Purchase Invoice Fixes

## Overview
This document lists ALL bugs fixed in the purchase invoice flow, particularly for the prepayment model.

---

## 🐛 Bug #11: Purchase inventory flow not following sales pattern

**Error:** `column "reference_type" of relation "stock_movements" does not exist`

**Occurred When:** Trying to mark prepayment invoice as "Received" (Pagada → Recibida)

**Root Cause:** The `consume_purchase_invoice_inventory()` function was using `reference_type` and `reference_id` columns that don't exist. The **sales flow uses only the `reference` field** with a simple pattern like `'sales_invoice:uuid'`.

**Files Fixed:**
1. **supabase/sql/core_schema.sql**
   - Changed `consume_purchase_invoice_inventory()` to use `reference` field only (like sales)
   - Changed `restore_purchase_invoice_inventory()` to delete using `reference` field only
   - Removed unnecessary `reference_type` and `reference_id` columns from stock_movements
   - Now follows the **exact same pattern as sales invoices**

**Impact:** ✅ Fixes inventory tracking for purchase invoices + Simplifies code by reusing sales pattern

## 🐛 Bug #12: Wrong column names in undoLastPayment()

**Error:** `column purchase_payments.purchase_invoice_id does not exist`

**Occurred When:** Trying to revert from "Pagada" back to "Confirmada"

**Root Cause:** The `undoLastPayment()` function was using old column names:
- `purchase_invoice_id` instead of `invoice_id`
- `payment_date` instead of `date`

**Files Fixed:**
1. **lib/modules/purchases/services/purchase_service.dart**
   - Line 554: Changed `.eq('purchase_invoice_id', invoiceId)` → `.eq('invoice_id', invoiceId)`
   - Line 555: Changed `.order('payment_date', ascending: false)` → `.order('date', ascending: false)`
   - Line 569: Changed `.eq('purchase_invoice_id', invoiceId)` → `.eq('invoice_id', invoiceId)`

**Impact:** ✅ Fixes payment deletion when reverting status

---

## 🐛 Bug #13: Wrong status reversion logic in undoLastPayment()

**Error:** No error, but wrong behavior - reverted to "Recibida" instead of "Confirmada"

**Occurred When:** Trying to revert prepayment invoice from "Pagada" back to "Confirmada"

**Root Cause:** The `undoLastPayment()` function always reverted to "received" status, but for prepayment invoices it should revert to "confirmed":
- **Prepayment flow:** Draft → Confirmed → **Paid** → Received
- **Standard flow:** Draft → Confirmed → Received → **Paid**

**Files Fixed:**
1. **lib/modules/purchases/services/purchase_service.dart**
   - Added logic to check `prepayment_model` field
   - If prepayment: revert to "confirmed"
   - If standard: revert to "received"

**Impact:** ✅ Fixes correct status reversion based on invoice model

## 🐛 Bug #14: Wrong column names in registerInvoicePayment()

**Potential Error:** `column purchase_payments.purchase_invoice_id does not exist`

**Occurrence:** This function appears to be unused, but had wrong column names

**Root Cause:** Old column names in payment data:
- `purchase_invoice_id` instead of `invoice_id`
- `payment_date` instead of `date`
- `payment_method` instead of `payment_method_id`
- `bank_account_id` (removed column)

**Files Fixed:**
1. **lib/modules/purchases/services/purchase_service.dart**
   - Line 450: Changed all column names to match new schema
   - Removed `bank_account_id` from payment data

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents future errors if this function gets called

---

## 🐛 Bug #15: Wrong column names in registerPayment() extension

**Potential Error:** `column purchase_payments.purchase_invoice_id does not exist`

**Occurrence:** Extension method with old column names

**Root Cause:** Old column names in payment INSERT:
- `purchase_invoice_id` instead of `invoice_id`
- `payment_date` instead of `date`
- `payment_method` instead of `payment_method_id`
- `bank_account_id` (removed column)

**Files Fixed:**
1. **lib/modules/purchases/services/purchase_service_extensions.dart**
   - Line 84: Changed all column names in INSERT statement
   - Removed `bank_account_id` field

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents future errors in extension methods

---

## 🐛 Bug #16: Wrong column names in getInvoicePayments() extension

**Error:** `column purchase_payments.purchase_invoice_id does not exist`

**Occurrence:** When trying to query payments for an invoice

**Root Cause:** Old column names in query:
- `.eq('purchase_invoice_id', invoiceId)` instead of `.eq('invoice_id', invoiceId)`
- `.order('payment_date', ascending: false)` instead of `.order('date', ascending: false)`

**Files Fixed:**
1. **lib/modules/purchases/services/purchase_service_extensions.dart**
   - Line 166: Changed to `invoice_id`
   - Line 167: Changed to `date`

**Impact:** ✅ Fixes payment queries in extension methods

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Prepayment Model (Draft → Confirmed → Paid → Received)
- [ ] Create draft prepayment invoice
- [ ] Confirm invoice (Draft → Confirmed)
- [ ] Register payment (Confirmed → Paid)
- [ ] Verify payment record created
- [ ] Verify journal entry created
- [ ] Mark as received (Paid → Received)
- [ ] Verify inventory increased
- [ ] Verify stock movement created with reference_type and reference_id
- [ ] Undo last action (Received → Paid)
- [ ] Verify inventory decreased
- [ ] Undo payment (Paid → Confirmed) ← **THIS WAS THE BUG!**
- [ ] Verify payment deleted
- [ ] Verify journal entry deleted
- [ ] Verify status is "Confirmed" not "Received"

### Standard Model (Draft → Confirmed → Received → Paid)
- [ ] Create draft standard invoice
- [ ] Confirm invoice (Draft → Confirmed)
- [ ] Mark as received (Confirmed → Received)
- [ ] Verify inventory increased
- [ ] Register payment (Received → Paid)
- [ ] Verify payment record created
- [ ] Undo payment (Paid → Received)
- [ ] Verify payment deleted
- [ ] Verify status is "Received"

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy SQL Schema**
   - Copy entire `supabase/sql/core_schema.sql` to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run the script
   - Verify migration message: "Added reference_type column to stock_movements"

2. **Hot Reload Flutter App**
   - All Dart changes will be applied
   - Test both prepayment and standard flows

3. **Verify Debug Output**
   - Watch console for debug messages when:
     - Marking invoice as received
     - Reverting invoice to confirmed

## 📝 Column Name Mapping (Quick Reference)

### purchase_payments table
| OLD Column Name | NEW Column Name | Type |
|----------------|-----------------|------|
| `purchase_invoice_id` | `invoice_id` | uuid |
| `payment_date` | `date` | timestamp |
| `bank_account_id` | *(removed)* | - |
| `payment_method` | `payment_method_id` | uuid |

### stock_movements table
| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `reference` | text | Document reference in format 'type:uuid' (e.g., 'sales_invoice:abc123', 'purchase_invoice:def456') |
| `movement_type` | text | Type of movement ('sales_invoice', 'purchase_invoice', etc.) |

**Note:** Both sales and purchase flows use the **same simple pattern** - no need for separate reference_type/reference_id columns!
