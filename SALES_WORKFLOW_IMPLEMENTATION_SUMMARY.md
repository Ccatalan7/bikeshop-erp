# üìã Sales Workflow Redesign - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Database Changes
- **File**: `supabase/sql/sales_workflow_redesign.sql`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ready to run
- **Changes**:
  - Added "confirmed" status to sales_invoices constraint
  - Migrates existing "sent" invoices with journal entries to "confirmed"
  - Updated `handle_sales_invoice_change()` trigger to DELETE (not reverse) journal entries
  - Updated `create_sales_invoice_journal_entry()` to skip "sent" status
  - Removed `delete_sales_invoice_journal_entry()` function

### 2. Data Model Updates
- **File**: `lib/shared/models/invoice.dart`
- **Changes**: Added `InvoiceStatus.confirmed` between sent and paid

### 3. UI Updates

#### Invoice Detail Page
- **File**: `lib/modules/sales/pages/invoice_detail_page.dart`
- **New Methods**:
  - `_markAsConfirmed()` - Confirms invoice
  - `_revertToDraft()` - Reverts sent ‚Üí draft
  - `_revertToSent()` - Reverts confirmed ‚Üí sent
- **Button Logic**:
  - Draft: Shows "Marcar como enviada"
  - Sent: Shows "Volver a borrador" + "Confirmar" (green)
  - Confirmed: Shows "Volver a enviada" (if unpaid)
- **Status Colors**: Added purple for confirmed

#### Invoice List Page
- **File**: `lib/modules/sales/pages/invoice_list_page.dart`
- **Changes**: Updated status chip to show confirmed (purple)

#### Invoice Form Page
- **File**: `lib/modules/sales/pages/invoice_form_page.dart`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added "Confirmada" to status display names
  - Added purple color for confirmed status

### 4. POS Integration
- **File**: `lib/modules/pos/services/pos_service.dart`
- **Changes**: POS now creates "confirmed" invoices (not "sent") when payment received
- **Reason**: POS sales should immediately enter accounting

### 5. Documentation
- **Files Created**:
  - `SALES_WORKFLOW_REDESIGN.md` - Complete guide to the new workflow
  - `SALES_WORKFLOW_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing scenarios

## üîÑ New Workflow

### Status Flow
```
Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Paid
  ‚Üì       ‚Üì        ‚Üì
(Reversible with DELETE, not reversal entries)
```

### When Things Happen

| Status | Accounting Effect | Inventory Effect |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Draft** | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None |
| **Sent** | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None |
| **Confirmed** ‚ú® | ‚úÖ Journal entry created | ‚úÖ Inventory deducted |
| **Paid** | ‚úÖ Payment entry created | - |

### Key Difference from Purchases

| Aspect | Sales (NEW) | Purchases |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Going Backward | DELETE journal entries | REVERSE journal entries |
| Audit Trail | Simpler (entries deleted) | Complete (reversals kept) |
| Approach | Zoho Books style | Traditional accounting |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (YOU MUST DO)

### 1. Run SQL Migration

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Create new query
# 3. Copy contents of: supabase/sql/sales_workflow_redesign.sql
# 4. Run the query
# 5. Verify "Query executed successfully"
```

### 2. Restart Flutter App

```bash
# Stop current app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
flutter run -d windows
```

### 3. Test the Workflow

Follow the testing guide: `SALES_WORKFLOW_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Critical Tests**:
1. Create invoice ‚Üí Send ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Pay
2. Confirm invoice ‚Üí Revert to sent (verify entry DELETED)
3. POS sale creates confirmed invoice

## üé® Visual Changes

### Status Badge Colors

| Status | Color | Where Visible |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Borrador | Grey | List, Detail, Form |
| Enviada | Blue | List, Detail, Form |
| **Confirmada** ‚ú® | **Purple** | List, Detail, Form |
| Pagada | Green | List, Detail, Form |
| Vencida | Red | List, Detail |
| Cancelada | Orange | List, Detail |

### Button Layout by Status

**Draft**:
```
[Editar] [Marcar como enviada]
```

**Sent**:
```
[Editar] [Volver a borrador] [Confirmar]
                                  ‚Üë
                              (Green button)
```

**Confirmed** (unpaid):
```
[Pagar factura] [Editar] [Volver a enviada]
```

**Confirmed** (paid):
```
[Editar]
(No revert button)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

1. **Existing "Sent" Invoices**: 
   - Will be migrated to "Confirmed" if they have journal entries
   - This is intentional and correct

2. **POS Behavior**: 
   - Now creates "Confirmed" invoices (not "Sent")
   - This ensures POS sales immediately enter accounting

3. **Journal Entry Deletion**: 
   - Reverting invoices now DELETES entries (not reverses)
   - This is cleaner but different from purchase workflow

---

## üîç How to Verify Changes

### In Database (after migration)

```sql
-- Check status constraint includes 'confirmed'
SELECT con.conname, pg_get_constraintdef(con.oid)
FROM pg_constraint con
WHERE conname LIKE '%sales_invoices%status%';

-- Check migrated invoices
SELECT id, invoice_number, status, created_at
FROM sales_invoices
WHERE status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check trigger function is updated
SELECT proname, prosrc
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = 'handle_sales_invoice_change';
```

### In UI

1. Open any sales invoice
2. Should see new "Confirmar" button when status is "Sent"
3. Status badge should show purple for "Confirmada"
4. Create new POS sale ‚Üí should be "Confirmada" not "Enviada"

---

## üìù Key Implementation Details

### DELETE vs REVERSE Logic

**Sales Invoice Trigger** (`handle_sales_invoice_change`):
```sql
-- When going backward, DELETE the journal entry
IF NEW.status IN ('draft', 'sent', 'cancelled') 
   AND OLD.status IN ('confirmed', 'paid') THEN
  
  -- Delete the entry completely
  DELETE FROM public.journal_entries
  WHERE source_module = 'sales_invoices'
    AND source_reference = OLD.id::text;
    
  -- Restore inventory
  -- (handled by inventory triggers)
END IF;
```

**Purchase Invoice** (for comparison):
```sql
-- When going backward, REVERSE the journal entry
IF NEW.status = 'draft' AND OLD.status = 'received' THEN
  
  -- Mark original as reversed
  UPDATE journal_entries SET status = 'reversed' ...
  
  -- Create reversal entry
  INSERT INTO journal_entries (reference = 'REV-xxx') ...
END IF;
```

### Status Transition Matrix

| From | To | Allowed? | Effect |
|------|-----|----------|--------|
| draft | sent | ‚úÖ Yes | None |
| sent | draft | ‚úÖ Yes | None |
| sent | confirmed | ‚úÖ Yes | Create journal entry |
| confirmed | sent | ‚úÖ Yes (if unpaid) | DELETE journal entry |
| confirmed | paid | ‚úÖ Yes | Create payment entry |
| paid | confirmed | ‚ùå No | N/A |

## üéØ Success Indicators

After migration and testing, you should see:

‚úÖ New invoices can be marked as "Confirmada"  
‚úÖ "Confirmada" invoices have journal entries  
‚úÖ "Enviada" invoices do NOT have journal entries  
‚úÖ Reverting from "Confirmada" to "Enviada" DELETES the entry  
‚úÖ No "REV-xxx" reversal entries for sales invoices  
‚úÖ POS creates "Confirmada" invoices  
‚úÖ Inventory correctly deducted/restored  

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Status 'confirmed' not allowed"
‚Üí Run the SQL migration in Supabase

### Journal entry created for "Sent" status
‚Üí Re-run the migration to update the trigger

### Can't revert confirmed invoice
‚Üí Check if it's paid (can't revert paid invoices)

### POS still creates "Sent" invoices
‚Üí Restart the Flutter app after code changes
