# ✅ Purchase Invoice Accounting - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Completed **simplified purchase invoice accounting** that:
- ✅ Uses account **1150 (Inventarios de Mercaderías)** for ALL inventory transactions (no transit account!)
- ✅ Applies **SAME accounting** for both Standard and Prepayment models
- ✅ Creates journal entries using **NEW column names** (entry_date, entry_type, notes, journal_entry_id, debit, credit)
- ✅ Implements **DELETE-based reversals** (not reversal entries) matching sales flow pattern
- ✅ Properly handles payment methods (Cash → 1101, Bank → 1110)

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `supabase/sql/FIX_PURCHASE_INVOICE_TRIGGERS.sql` (480 lines)

**Purpose:** Complete purchase invoice accounting implementation

**Functions Implemented:**

#### Function 1: `create_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(p_invoice_id UUID)`
- **Called When:** Purchase invoice status → 'confirmed'
- **Accounting Entry:**
  ```
  DR: 1150 Inventarios de Mercaderías = Subtotal
  DR: 1140 IVA Crédito Fiscal = IVA Amount
  CR: 2120 Cuentas por Pagar = Total
  ```
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses `ensure_account()` to get account IDs
  - Validates invoice exists and has non-zero total
  - Checks for existing entry to prevent duplicates
  - Uses NEW column names throughout
  - Entry type = 'purchase' (matches CHECK constraint)
  - Source module = 'purchase_invoices'

#### Function 2: `delete_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(p_invoice_id UUID)`
- **Called When:** Reverting status from 'confirmed' to 'sent'
- **Action:** `DELETE FROM journal_entries WHERE source_module='purchase_invoices' AND source_reference=invoice_id`
- **Key Features:**
  - CASCADE delete removes journal_lines automatically
  - Returns row count for logging
  - No reversal entry created (direct DELETE)

#### Function 3: `create_purchase_payment_journal_entry(p_payment_id UUID)`
- **Called When:** Payment registered on purchase invoice
- **Accounting Entry:**
  ```
  DR: 2120 Cuentas por Pagar = Payment Amount
  CR: 1101 Caja General OR 1110 Bancos = Payment Amount
  ```
- **Payment Method Logic:**
  - `cash` → Credit 1101 (Caja General)
  - `transfer`, `card`, `check` → Credit 1110 (Bancos - Cuenta Corriente)
  - Other → Credit 1190 (Otros Activos Corrientes)
- **Key Features:**
  - Joins with purchase_invoices to get supplier name
  - Uses payment_date as entry_date
  - Entry type = 'payment'
  - Source module = 'purchase_payments'

#### Function 4: `delete_purchase_payment_journal_entry(p_payment_id UUID)`
- **Called When:** "Deshacer Pago" clicked
- **Action:** `DELETE FROM journal_entries WHERE source_module='purchase_payments' AND source_reference=payment_id`
- **Key Features:**
  - Same pattern as sales payment deletion
  - Enables proper payment reversal workflow

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: NO Transit Account (1155)
**Rejected:** Complex approach using "Inventario en Tránsito" for prepayment model

**Reason:** User feedback - "I'd use just the 1150 for every transaction"

**Impact:** 
- Simpler accounting (one inventory account)
- Same accounting for both Standard and Prepayment
- Difference is only WORKFLOW timing, not accounting

### Decision 2: Same Accounting for Both Models
**Standard Model:** Borrador → Enviada → Confirmada → Recibida → Pagada

**Prepayment Model:** Borrador → Enviada → Confirmada → Pagada → Recibida

**Key Insight:** Both models record inventory + AP when invoice confirmed. Payment timing is UI/workflow difference only.

### Decision 3: DELETE-Based Reversals
**Rejected:** Creating offsetting reversal journal entries

**Chosen:** Direct DELETE of journal entries when status reverted

**Reason:** Matches sales invoice flow pattern, cleaner audit trail for SMB

### Decision 4: Payment Method → Account Mapping
**Cash (efectivo):** Credit account 1101 (Caja General)

**Non-Cash (transfer/card/check):** Credit account 1110 (Bancos - Cuenta Corriente)

**Reason:** Matches sales payment logic, uses shared accounts correctly

## 📊 Account Structure (Final)

### Shared Accounts (3)
| Code | Name | Type | Used By |
|------|------|------|---------|
| 1150 | Inventarios de Mercaderías | Asset | Sales (CR), Purchase (DR) |
| 1101 | Caja General | Asset | Sales (DR), Purchase (CR) when cash |
| 1110 | Bancos - Cuenta Corriente | Asset | Sales (DR), Purchase (CR) when bank |

### Sales-Exclusive Accounts (4)
| Code | Name | Type | Usage |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 1120 | Cuentas por Cobrar Comerciales | Asset | Debit when sale on credit |
| 4100 | Ingresos por Ventas | Revenue | Credit when sale confirmed |
| 2150 | IVA Débito Fiscal | Liability | Credit when sale with IVA |
| 5100 | Costo de Ventas | Expense | Debit when sale confirmed |

### Purchase-Exclusive Accounts (2)
| Code | Name | Type | Usage |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 1140 | IVA Crédito Fiscal | Asset | Debit when purchase with IVA |
| 2120 | Cuentas por Pagar | Liability | Credit when purchase confirmed |

**REMOVED:** ~~1155 - Inventario en Tránsito~~ (deemed too complex)

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### Sales Invoice Flow (Reference)
```
Borrador → Enviada → Confirmada → Pagada
                     ↓            ↓
                Journal Entry  Payment Entry
                DR 1120        DR 1101/1110
                DR 5100        CR 1120
                CR 4100
                CR 2150
                CR 1150
```

### Purchase Invoice Flow (New)
```
Standard:
Borrador → Enviada → Confirmada → Recibida → Pagada
                     ↓                        ↓
                Journal Entry              Payment Entry
                DR 1150                    DR 2120
                DR 1140                    CR 1101/1110
                CR 2120

Prepayment:
Borrador → Enviada → Confirmada → Pagada → Recibida
                     ↓            ↓
                Journal Entry  Payment Entry
                DR 1150        DR 2120
                DR 1140        CR 1101/1110
                CR 2120
```

**Key Difference:** Payment happens at different workflow stage, but accounting is IDENTICAL.

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test 1: Invoice Confirmation (Critical)
- [ ] Create purchase invoice with products
- [ ] Change status → Confirmada
- [ ] Verify journal entry created with entry_type='purchase'
- [ ] Verify account 1150 debited (NOT 1155!)
- [ ] Verify IVA account 1140 debited
- [ ] Verify AP account 2120 credited
- [ ] Verify inventory increased

### Test 2: Cash Payment (Critical)
- [ ] Register payment with method = 'cash'
- [ ] Verify journal entry created with entry_type='payment'
- [ ] Verify AP 2120 debited
- [ ] Verify Caja 1101 credited (NOT Bancos!)

### Test 3: Bank Payment (Critical)
- [ ] Register payment with method = 'transfer'
- [ ] Verify journal entry uses Bancos 1110 (NOT Caja!)

### Test 4: Payment Reversal (Critical)
- [ ] Click "Deshacer Pago"
- [ ] Verify payment journal entry DELETED (not reversed)
- [ ] Verify AP balance restored

### Test 5: Invoice Reversal (Critical)
- [ ] Revert status from Confirmada → Enviada
- [ ] Verify invoice journal entry DELETED
- [ ] Verify inventory decreased

### Test 6: Sales Flow Still Works (Critical)
- [ ] Create sales invoice
- [ ] Confirm → verify uses account 1150 (credit)
- [ ] Pay → verify cash/bank entry
- [ ] Undo payment → verify deletion
- [ ] **This ensures shared account 1150 wasn't broken!**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Validations

### Before Deployment
1. **Account 1150 name MUST be "Inventarios de Mercaderías"**
   - If it's "Inventario", run FIX_SALES_AND_PURCHASE_ACCOUNTS.sql first!
   - This was the original bug that broke sales invoices

2. **Schema uses NEW column names:**
   - journal_entries: `entry_date`, `entry_type`, `notes` (not date, type, description)
   - journal_lines: `journal_entry_id`, `debit`, `credit` (not entry_id, debit_amount, credit_amount)

3. **CHECK constraint allows 'purchase' entry_type:**
   - Should be: `entry_type IN ('manual', 'sale', 'purchase', 'payment', ...)`
   - NOT: `entry_type IN ('sales', 'purchases', ...)`

### After Deployment
1. **All 4 functions created** - Check with `\df *purchase*journal*`
2. **Test invoice confirmation** - Verify journal entry created
3. **Test payment registration** - Verify payment entry created
4. **Test both reversals** - Verify entries deleted (not reversed)
5. **Sales flow unaffected** - Create test sales invoice to confirm

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Account 1150 is SHARED** - Changes to this account affect BOTH sales and purchase flows!

2. **Column names matter** - Using old names (date, type, description) will cause errors

3. **Entry types are singular** - Use 'sale' and 'purchase' (not 'sales' or 'purchases')

4. **DELETE means DELETE** - Reversals remove entries completely, not create offsetting entries

5. **Payment method matters** - Cash vs Bank affects which account is credited

6. **Test sales flow after deployment** - Ensure shared account 1150 still works for sales!

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] FIX_PURCHASE_INVOICE_TRIGGERS.sql reviewed
- [ ] All 4 functions use correct column names
- [ ] Account 1150 name verified as "Inventarios de Mercaderías"
- [ ] Deployment guide read and understood
