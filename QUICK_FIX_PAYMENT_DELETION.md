4. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_payment_journal_deletion_complete.sql`
5. Click **Run**
6. Check logs for âœ… confirmation messages

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to project root

2. **Pay invoice** â†’ Check accounting (2 journal entries exist)

WHERE je.source_module = 'sales_payments'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sales_payments sp 
    WHERE sp.id::text = je.source_reference
  );
```
