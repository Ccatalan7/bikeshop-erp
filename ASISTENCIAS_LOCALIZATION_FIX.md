# 🔧 Asistencias - Material Localization Fix

## 🐛 Problem

When trying to edit check-in/check-out times in the attendance detail dialog, clicking on the time fields caused the app to crash with the error:

```
No MaterialLocalizations found.
FlutterError: No MaterialLocalizations found
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The Flutter app was missing proper Material localization configuration. When `showDatePicker()` or `showTimePicker()` is called, Flutter looks for `MaterialLocalizations` in the widget tree to provide localized text for buttons, labels, and date formats.

Without `flutter_localizations` configured, the date/time pickers fail to find the required localization data, causing the crash.

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Added flutter_localizations Package

**File: `pubspec.yaml`**

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:  # ← Added
    sdk: flutter
  
  # ... rest of dependencies
  
  # Updated intl version to be compatible
  intl: ^0.20.0  # ← Updated from ^0.19.0
```

### 2. Updated main.dart with Localization Delegates

**File: `lib/main.dart`**

Added import:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
```

Added localization configuration to `MaterialApp.router`:
```dart
MaterialApp.router(
  title: 'Vinabike ERP',
  theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
  darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
  themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
  routerConfig: AppRouter.createRouter(authService),
  debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
  
  // ✅ Added localization support
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  supportedLocales: const [
    Locale('es', ''), // Spanish (default for Chile)
    Locale('en', ''), // English
  ],
  locale: const Locale('es', ''), // Default locale
  
  builder: (context, child) {
    return child ?? const SizedBox.shrink();
  },
)
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Date Picker Localization
- **Buttons**: "OK", "CANCEL" → localized to Spanish: "ACEPTAR", "CANCELAR"
- **Month names**: English → Spanish (Enero, Febrero, Marzo, etc.)
- **Day names**: Mon, Tue, Wed → Lun, Mar, Mié
- **Date format**: Follows locale conventions (DD/MM/YYYY for Spanish)

### Time Picker Localization
- **Buttons**: Properly localized
- **Hour format**: Supports 24-hour format (forced in code for business use)
- **Labels**: Localized text for "Hora", "Minuto"

### General Benefits
- ✅ No more crashes when opening date/time pickers
- ✅ Consistent Spanish localization throughout the app
- ✅ Proper support for Chilean date/time formats
- ✅ Foundation for future multi-language support

## 🌍 Locale Configuration

The app is now configured for:
- **Primary locale**: Spanish (`es`) - Default for Chile
- **Secondary locale**: English (`en`) - For future internationalization
- **Default format**: DD/MM/YYYY, 24-hour time
- **Currency**: CLP (Chilean Peso) - via intl package
