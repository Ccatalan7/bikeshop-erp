2. `auth_user_id` stored in `customers` table
3. CustomerAccountService listens to auth state changes
4. Auto-loads profile, addresses, orders on login
5. Clears data on logout

### Address Management
- First address is automatically set as default
- Trigger ensures only one default address per customer
- Changing default automatically unsets previous default
- Full address formatting handled by model getter

### Order Loading
- Uses OnlineOrder model from website_models.dart
- Orders filtered by customer_id
- Status colors and icons defined in UI layer
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions (optional enhancement)
