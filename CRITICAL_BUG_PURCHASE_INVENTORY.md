# üö® CRITICAL BUG FOUND: Purchase Invoice Inventory Trigger Logic

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEM DISCOVERED

The `handle_purchase_invoice_change()` trigger treats ALL non-draft/sent/cancelled statuses as "posted", which means:

### **Current (BROKEN) Logic:**
```sql
v_non_posted := array['draft', 'sent', 'cancelled'];
v_posted := everything else  -- This includes 'confirmed', 'received', AND 'paid'!
```

**What happens:**
- Status = 'confirmed' ‚Üí **Consumes inventory** ‚ùå WRONG!
- Status = 'received' ‚Üí **Consumes inventory** ‚úÖ CORRECT
- Status = 'paid' ‚Üí **Consumes inventory** ‚ùå WRONG!

### **Impact on Both Models:**

#### Standard Model (prepayment_model = false)
**Expected Flow:** Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí **Received** (consume inventory) ‚Üí Paid

**What Actually Happens:**
1. Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚úÖ OK (no inventory change)
2. Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚ùå **BUG: Inventory consumed prematurely!**
3. Confirmed ‚Üí Received ‚ùå **Inventory consumed AGAIN** (duplicate)
4. Received ‚Üí Paid ‚úÖ OK (inventory already consumed)

**Result:** Inventory gets consumed at **BOTH** `confirmed` and `received`, effectively **DOUBLE-DEDUCTING!** üí•

#### Prepayment Model (prepayment_model = true)
**Expected Flow:** Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Paid ‚Üí **Received** (consume inventory)

**What Actually Happens:**
1. Draft ‚Üí Sent ‚úÖ OK (no inventory change)
2. Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚ùå **BUG: Inventory consumed prematurely!**
3. Confirmed ‚Üí Paid ‚ùå **Inventory consumed AGAIN** (duplicate)
4. Paid ‚Üí Received ‚ùå **Inventory consumed THIRD TIME!** (triple!)

**Result:** Inventory gets consumed at **THREE** statuses: `confirmed`, `paid`, AND `received`! **TRIPLE-DEDUCTING!** üí•üí•üí•

## üéØ Correct Business Logic

### **For Purchase Invoices (Both Models):**
- Inventory should **ONLY** be consumed when goods are physically received
- This happens at **ONE status only: `received`**
- Does not matter if payment happened before or after
- Physical receipt = inventory increase

### **Status ‚Üí Inventory Action Map:**
| Status | Standard Model | Prepayment Model | Action |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| draft | No inventory | No inventory | ‚úÖ None |
| sent | No inventory | No inventory | ‚úÖ None |
| confirmed | No inventory | No inventory | ‚úÖ None |
| paid | No inventory | No inventory | ‚úÖ None |
| **received** | **Consume** | **Consume** | ‚úÖ **ONLY HERE** |
| cancelled | No inventory | No inventory | ‚úÖ None |

### **Status ‚Üí Journal Entry Map:**
| Status | Action | Entry Type |
|--------|--------|------------|
| draft | None | - |
| sent | None | - |
| confirmed | Create invoice entry | PINV (Debit: Inventory/Expense, Credit: AP) |
| paid | Payment journal entry | PAY (handled by payment trigger) |
| received | None (already at confirmed) | - |
| cancelled | Delete entries | - |

## ‚úÖ CORRECT TRIGGER LOGIC

### **For Purchase Invoices:**
```sql
-- Inventory: ONLY at 'received' status
if OLD.status != 'received' AND NEW.status = 'received' then
  -- Transitioning TO received: consume inventory
  perform public.consume_purchase_invoice_inventory(NEW);
elsif OLD.status = 'received' AND NEW.status != 'received' then
  -- Transitioning FROM received: restore inventory
  perform public.restore_purchase_invoice_inventory(OLD);
end if;

-- Journal Entries: At 'confirmed' status
if OLD.status != 'confirmed' AND NEW.status IN ('confirmed', 'received', 'paid') then
  -- Transitioning TO confirmed (or any status after): create invoice entry
  perform public.create_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(NEW);
elsif OLD.status IN ('confirmed', 'received', 'paid') AND NEW.status IN ('draft', 'sent', 'cancelled') then
  -- Transitioning FROM confirmed (or after) back to pre-confirmed: delete entry
  perform public.delete_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(OLD.id);
elsif OLD.status IN ('confirmed', 'received', 'paid') AND NEW.status IN ('confirmed', 'received', 'paid') then
  -- Staying in post-confirmed statuses but changing: recreate entry
  perform public.delete_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(OLD.id);
  perform public.create_purchase_invoice_journal_entry(NEW);
end if;
```

## üîß THE FIX

### **Updated `handle_purchase_invoice_change()` function:**

```sql

    raise notice 'handle_purchase_invoice_change: DELETE invoice %, status %', OLD.id, v_old_status;
    
    -- Restore inventory if was received
    if v_old_status = 'received' then

## üß™ Test Scenarios (MUST VERIFY)

### **Test 1: Standard Model - Forward Flow**
1. Create invoice: Draft ‚Üí Inventory = 0 ‚úÖ
2. Mark as Sent ‚Üí Inventory = 0 ‚úÖ
3. Confirm ‚Üí Inventory = 0, Journal Entry created ‚úÖ
4. Mark as Received ‚Üí **Inventory += qty** ‚úÖ
5. Add Payment ‚Üí Inventory unchanged, Payment journal entry ‚úÖ

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM stock_movements WHERE reference LIKE 'PINV-%' ORDER BY created_at;
-- Should show ONLY ONE movement when status = 'received'
```

### **Test 2: Standard Model - Backward Flow**
1. Paid invoice (inventory already added)
2. Undo payment ‚Üí Inventory unchanged ‚úÖ
3. Revert from Received to Confirmed ‚Üí **Inventory -= qty (restored)** ‚úÖ
4. Revert to Sent ‚Üí Journal entry deleted ‚úÖ
5. Revert to Draft ‚Üí No change ‚úÖ

### **Test 3: Prepayment Model - Forward Flow**
1. Create invoice: Draft ‚Üí Inventory = 0 ‚úÖ
2. Mark as Sent ‚Üí Inventory = 0 ‚úÖ
3. Confirm ‚Üí Inventory = 0, Journal Entry created ‚úÖ
4. Add Payment ‚Üí Inventory = 0, Payment journal entry ‚úÖ
5. Mark as Received ‚Üí **Inventory += qty** ‚úÖ

**Database Check:**
```sql
-- Should show inventory movement ONLY at 'received', NOT at 'paid'
SELECT 
  si.invoice_number,
  si.status,
  sm.movement_type,
  sm.quantity,
  sm.created_at
FROM purchase_invoices si
LEFT JOIN stock_movements sm ON sm.reference = 'PINV-' || si.id::text
WHERE si.prepayment_model = true
ORDER BY si.created_at, sm.created_at;
```

### **Test 4: Prepayment Model - Backward Flow**
1. Received invoice (inventory already added, payment already done)
2. Revert from Received to Paid ‚Üí **Inventory -= qty (restored)** ‚úÖ
3. Undo payment ‚Üí Inventory unchanged ‚úÖ
4. Revert to Confirmed ‚Üí Inventory unchanged ‚úÖ

### **Test 5: Status Jump (Edge Case)**
1. Draft invoice
2. Directly update to 'received' (skip confirmed)
3. Should: Consume inventory ‚úÖ, Create journal entry ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **DO NOT DEPLOY** current code to production
2. **MUST FIX** `handle_purchase_invoice_change()` trigger first
3. **MUST TEST** all scenarios above before deployment
4. **CHECK** existing data for duplicate stock movements

---

## üîç How to Check for Existing Corruption

```sql
-- Check for duplicate stock movements per invoice
SELECT 
  reference,
  COUNT(*) as movement_count,
  SUM(quantity) as total_qty
FROM stock_movements
WHERE reference LIKE 'PINV-%'
  AND movement_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY reference
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- If any rows returned: inventory was double/triple counted!

-- Check invoice status vs inventory movements
SELECT 
  pi.invoice_number,
  pi.status,
  COUNT(sm.id) as movement_count
FROM purchase_invoices pi
LEFT JOIN stock_movements sm ON sm.reference = 'PINV-' || pi.id::text
WHERE pi.status != 'received'
GROUP BY pi.id, pi.invoice_number, pi.status
HAVING COUNT(sm.id) > 0;
-- If any rows: inventory was consumed at wrong status!
```

**Status:** üö® **BLOCKER - MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**  
**Priority:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes (update trigger + test)  
**User Was Right:** YES - Good catch! üëç
