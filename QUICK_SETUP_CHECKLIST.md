  - COMP-xxx (reversed)
  - REV-COMP-xxx
  - COMP-xxx (reversed)

### Test Cancellation
- [ ] Create invoice and mark as "Received"
- [ ] Mark as "Cancelled"
- [ ] Verify inventory reverses
- [ ] Verify journal entry reverses

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### SQL migration fails
- **Check**: Do you have write permissions in Supabase?
- **Check**: Are there conflicting table/function names?
- **Fix**: Drop existing `purchase_payments` table if it exists (empty)
- **Fix**: Run migration sections one at a time

### Re-activation still creates reversals
- **Check**: Did SQL migration run successfully?
- **Check**: Look in Supabase logs for error messages
- **Fix**: Re-run the migration
- **Fix**: Verify `create_purchase_invoice_journal_entry()` updated

### Payment journal entry not created
- **Check**: Do accounts 2100/2101 (AP) exist?
- **Check**: Do accounts 1100/1101 (Cash/Bank) exist?
- **Fix**: Create missing accounts in "Contabilidad" ‚Üí "Cuentas"

### Purchase payments page is empty
- **Check**: Did you run the SQL migration?
- **Check**: Have you marked any invoice as "paid"?
- **Fix**: Create test payment by marking invoice as paid

### Compilation errors
- **Check**: Are all new files imported correctly?
- **Fix**: Run `flutter pub get`
- **Fix**: Restart IDE/VS Code
