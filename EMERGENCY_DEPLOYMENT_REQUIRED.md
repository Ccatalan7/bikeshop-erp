# üö® EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED - All Critical Bugs Fixed

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Application broken until deployment  
**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Priority**: üî• **DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY**

---

## üö® Current Situation

**Payment registration is COMPLETELY BROKEN** due to Bug #9:
- ‚ùå Cannot save ANY purchase payments (standard or prepayment)
- ‚ùå Error: `"record 'new' has no field 'purchase_invoice_id'"`
- ‚ùå Invoice payment workflow unusable
- ‚ùå Supplier payments cannot be recorded

**All other critical bugs are also present in production** (Bugs #1-8).

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed (9 Critical Bugs)

### **Bug #1: Inventory Double/Triple-Counting** 
- **Issue**: Inventory consumed at confirmed/paid/received (2-3x overcounting)
- **Fix**: Only consume at 'received' status
- **File**: `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_INVENTORY.md`

### **Bug #2: Journal Entry Recreation**
- **Issue**: Journal recreated on EVERY status change (audit trail pollution)
- **Fix**: Create ONCE at 'confirmed', only recreate if amounts change
- **File**: `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_JOURNAL.md`

### **Bug #3: Payment Recalculation Status Corruption**
- **Issue**: Status stayed same when payments deleted (not respecting prepayment models)
- **Fix**: Model-aware revert logic (standard vs prepayment)
- **File**: `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_PAYMENT_RECALC.md`

### **Bug #4: Infinite Recursion Stack Overflow**
- **Issue**: Trigger ‚Üí recalculate ‚Üí update ‚Üí trigger ‚Üí recalculate... ‚Üí CRASH
- **Fix**: Guard to skip recalculate when only payment fields changed
- **File**: `CRITICAL_FIX_INFINITE_RECURSION.md`

### **Bug #5: Missing Database Columns**
- **Issue**: purchase_invoices table missing tax, paid_amount, balance, prepayment_model
- **Fix**: Added all required columns with migrations
- **File**: `FIX_MISSING_PURCHASE_INVOICE_COLUMNS.md`

### **Bug #6: Column Name Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Flutter using 'iva_amount' but database has 'tax'
- **Fix**: Updated Flutter model to use 'tax'
- **File**: `FIX_PREPAYMENT_TAX_COLUMN_MAPPING.md`

### **Bug #7: Empty State Button Bug**
- **Issue**: Empty state button bypassed model selection dialog
- **Fix**: Updated onCreate callback to show dialog first
- **File**: `FIX_EMPTY_STATE_PREPAYMENT_BUG.md`

### **Bug #8: Missing Date Column**
- **Issue**: purchase_payments table missing 'date' column
- **Fix**: Added migration to create date column if missing
- **File**: `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_PAYMENTS_DATE.md`

### **Bug #9: Trigger Column Name Cache** üî• **NEW!**
- **Issue**: Trigger using cached type with old column name 'purchase_invoice_id'
- **Fix**: DROP and recreate trigger to refresh type cache
- **File**: `CRITICAL_BUG_TRIGGER_COLUMN_CACHE.md`

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS (DO THIS NOW!)

### Step 1: Backup Existing Data
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor before deployment
COPY (SELECT * FROM purchase_invoices) TO '/tmp/purchase_invoices_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM purchase_payments) TO '/tmp/purchase_payments_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM journal_entries WHERE source_module LIKE 'purchase%') TO '/tmp/purchase_journals_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM stock_movements WHERE reference LIKE 'purchase_invoice:%') TO '/tmp/purchase_stock_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

### Step 2: Deploy core_schema.sql

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar

2. **Create New Query**
   - Click "+ New query"

3. **Copy Entire Schema File**
   - Open: `c:\dev\ProjectVinabike\supabase\sql\core_schema.sql`
   - Select ALL (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)

4. **Paste and Run**
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
   - Click "Run" button
   - **Wait for completion** (~30-60 seconds)

5. **Watch for Success Messages**
   You should see messages like:
   ```
   ‚úÖ "Adding date column to purchase_payments..."
   ‚úÖ "Adding tax column to purchase_invoices..."
   ‚úÖ "Adding paid_amount column to purchase_invoices..."
   ‚úÖ "Adding balance column to purchase_invoices..."
   ‚úÖ "Adding prepayment_model column to purchase_invoices..."
   ‚úÖ "Renaming purchase_invoice_id to invoice_id..."
   ‚úÖ "DROP TRIGGER trg_purchase_payments_change"
   ‚úÖ "CREATE TRIGGER trg_purchase_payments_change"
   ‚úÖ "purchase_payments migration check complete"
   ```

6. **Check for Errors**
   - If you see any RED errors, copy them and report immediately
   - Common errors (safe to ignore):
     - "column already exists" (means migration already ran)
     - "trigger does not exist" (safe, means it's creating it fresh)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Run these verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Verify purchase_invoices columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'purchase_invoices' 
  AND column_name IN ('tax', 'paid_amount', 'balance', 'prepayment_model')
ORDER BY column_name;
-- Expected: 4 rows

-- 2. Verify purchase_payments columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'purchase_payments' 
  AND column_name IN ('invoice_id', 'date', 'payment_method_id')
ORDER BY column_name;
-- Expected: 3 rows (invoice_id, date, payment_method_id)

-- 3. Verify trigger exists with new definition
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass, proname
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_proc p ON p.oid = t.tgfoid
WHERE tgname = 'trg_purchase_payments_change';
-- Expected: 1 row

-- 4. Verify functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_name LIKE '%purchase%payment%'
ORDER BY routine_name;
-- Expected: handle_purchase_payment_change, recalculate_purchase_invoice_payments, create_purchase_payment_journal_entry, delete_purchase_payment_journal_entry
```

### Step 4: Test Payment Registration (CRITICAL!)

**IMMEDIATELY after deployment, test this:**

1. **Open the app** (refresh if already open)
2. **Navigate to Purchases** ‚Üí Find any confirmed invoice
3. **Click "Registrar Pago"**
4. **Fill payment details**:
   - Amount: any valid amount
   - Payment method: select any (Cash, Bank Transfer, etc.)
   - Reference: add if required
5. **Click "Guardar Pago"**
6. **Expected**: ‚úÖ Success message, no errors
7. **Check**: Status updates correctly

**If you get ANY error**, copy the EXACT error message and report immediately.

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing Checklist

### Immediate Tests (Do First - 5 minutes)

- [ ] **Test 1: Standard Invoice Payment**
  - Create standard invoice ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Receive ‚Üí Pay
  - **Expected**: Payment saves, status ‚Üí 'paid'
  - **Verify**: No errors

- [ ] **Test 2: Prepayment Invoice Payment**
  - Create prepayment invoice ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Pay (before receiving)
  - **Expected**: Payment saves, status ‚Üí 'paid'
  - **Verify**: No "purchase_invoice_id" error

- [ ] **Test 3: Payment with Bank Transfer**
  - Select "Transferencia Bancaria"
  - Enter reference number
  - Save payment
  - **Expected**: Reference required validation works, payment saves

### Comprehensive Tests (Do Next - 30 minutes)

Use test scenarios from these documents:
- **Inventory tests** (5 scenarios): `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_INVENTORY.md`
- **Journal tests** (6 scenarios): `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_JOURNAL.md`
- **Payment tests** (5 scenarios): `CRITICAL_BUG_PURCHASE_PAYMENT_RECALC.md`
- **Recursion tests** (4 scenarios): `CRITICAL_FIX_INFINITE_RECURSION.md`
- **Complete workflow** (20 scenarios): `COMPREHENSIVE_FORWARD_BACKWARD_VERIFICATION.md`

## üîç What to Watch For

### Success Indicators ‚úÖ
- Payments save without errors
- Status transitions work correctly
- Journal entries created automatically
- Inventory only changes at 'received' status
- No stack overflow errors
- No duplicate entries

### Warning Signs ‚ùå
- Any "column not found" errors ‚Üí Report immediately
- Any "trigger" errors ‚Üí Report immediately
- Payment saves but status doesn't change ‚Üí Check recalculate function
- Inventory changes multiple times ‚Üí Check inventory trigger
- Journal entries duplicated ‚Üí Check journal trigger

---

## üìä Expected Impact

### Before Deployment (BROKEN)
- ‚ùå Zero payments can be saved
- ‚ùå Inventory counted 2-3 times
- ‚ùå Journal entries duplicated
- ‚ùå Status corruption on payment deletion
- ‚ùå Stack overflow on invoice creation
- ‚ùå Prepayment model not working
- ‚ùå Application unusable for purchase payments

### After Deployment (FIXED)
- ‚úÖ All payments save successfully
- ‚úÖ Inventory counted once (at received)
- ‚úÖ Journal created once (at confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Status transitions respect both models
- ‚úÖ No infinite recursion
- ‚úÖ Prepayment model fully functional
- ‚úÖ Application fully operational

---

## üÜò Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If deployment causes unexpected issues:

1. **Restore backup data**:
   ```sql
   -- Only if absolutely necessary
   DELETE FROM purchase_payments WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   DELETE FROM purchase_invoices WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   -- Then restore from CSV backups
   ```

2. **Report exact error** with:
   - Screenshot of error message
   - SQL query that caused error
   - Database logs from Supabase

3. **Do NOT revert schema** - fixes are cumulative and safe

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter ANY issues during deployment:

1. **Stop and capture error details**:
   - Screenshot of error
   - Copy exact error message
   - Note which step failed

2. **Check database logs**:
   - Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for SQL errors

3. **Report for immediate assistance**
