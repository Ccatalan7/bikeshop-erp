# ðŸ”§ Bikeshop Module - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Cannot view job details from client logbook

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking on a job card shows error
- App crashes when navigating to job details
- Blank page when opening job

**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

#### A. Database foreign key constraint error
```
Error: violates foreign key constraint
```
**Solution:** Verify the job exists in database and has valid `bike_id` and `customer_id`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mechanic_jobs WHERE id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID';
SELECT * FROM bikes WHERE id = 'BIKE_ID_FROM_JOB';
```

#### B. Missing bike data
```
Error: Cannot read property 'displayName' of null
```
**Solution:** Ensure the bike associated with the job exists:
```sql
-- Check if bike exists
SELECT * FROM bikes WHERE id = (
  SELECT bike_id FROM mechanic_jobs WHERE id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID'
);

-- If bike is missing, update job to use correct bike_id
UPDATE mechanic_jobs 
SET bike_id = 'CORRECT_BIKE_ID' 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID';
```

#### C. Job items query error
```
Error: column "job_id" does not exist
```
**Solution:** Check if `job_items` table exists and has correct schema:
```sql
-- Verify table structure
\d job_items

-- Should have columns: id, job_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, total_price
```

#### D. Timeline query error
```
Error: relation "mechanic_job_timeline" does not exist
```
**Solution:** The timeline table might not exist. Check `core_schema.sql` and deploy:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE '%timeline%';
```

### Issue 2: Photos don't upload

**Symptoms:**
- "Error uploading image" message
- Photos selected but not saved
- Storage bucket error

**Solution:**
1. Create Supabase storage bucket named `bike-images`
2. Enable public access on bucket
3. Add storage policies:
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'bike-images');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public downloads"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'bike-images');
```

### Issue 3: Parts/items not saving

**Symptoms:**
- Parts added but don't appear after save
- "Error adding job item" message

**Solution:**
1. Check `job_items` table exists
2. Verify `product_id` references valid products in `products` table
3. Check for trigger errors in logs

### Issue 4: Timeline not showing

**Symptoms:**
- Timeline section is empty
- No status change history

**Solution:**
1. Verify `mechanic_job_timeline` table exists
2. Check if triggers are creating timeline entries:
```sql
-- Check triggers
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgrelid = 'mechanic_jobs'::regclass;

-- Should see: handle_mechanic_job_timeline_trigger
```
3. Manually test trigger:
```sql
UPDATE mechanic_jobs SET status = 'en_progreso' WHERE id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID';
SELECT * FROM mechanic_job_timeline WHERE job_id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID';
```

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Database Schema
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename LIKE '%bike%' OR tablename LIKE '%job%' OR tablename LIKE '%mechanic%';
```

Expected tables:
- `bikes`
- `mechanic_jobs`
- `job_items`
- `job_labor`
- `mechanic_job_timeline`
- `service_packages` (optional)

### 2. Check Flutter Console
Run app with:
```bash
flutter run -d windows --verbose
```

Look for errors in console when clicking on job.

### 3. Check Supabase Logs
- Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Logs
- Look for errors around the time you clicked the job
- Common errors: RLS policy violations, foreign key constraints

### 4. Verify Data Integrity
```sql
-- Check for orphaned jobs (jobs without valid bikes)
SELECT mj.id, mj.job_number, mj.bike_id
FROM mechanic_jobs mj
LEFT JOIN bikes b ON b.id = mj.bike_id
WHERE b.id IS NULL;

-- Check for jobs without customers
SELECT mj.id, mj.job_number, mj.customer_id
FROM mechanic_jobs mj
LEFT JOIN customers c ON c.id = mj.customer_id
WHERE c.id IS NULL;
```

### 5. Re-deploy Schema
If tables or functions are missing:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, copy entire content of:
# supabase/sql/core_schema.sql
# and execute it
```

## Error Messages Reference

| Error | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `Foreign key violation` | Invalid bike_id or customer_id | Update job with valid IDs |
| `Column does not exist` | Schema not deployed | Deploy core_schema.sql |
| `Permission denied` | RLS policy blocking access | Check RLS policies on tables |
| `Null check operator used on null` | Missing data in database | Verify all required fields exist |
| `Type error` | Data type mismatch | Check if numeric fields have valid numbers |
| `Storage bucket not found` | Bucket not created | Create `bike-images` bucket |

## Getting Help

If issue persists:
1. âœ… Check terminal output for full error stack trace
2. âœ… Share error message with context
3. âœ… Verify database schema is fully deployed
4. âœ… Test with simple data first (minimal job with all required fields)

## Quick Test Checklist

Before reporting an issue, verify:
- [ ] `core_schema.sql` has been deployed to Supabase
- [ ] All tables exist (`bikes`, `mechanic_jobs`, `job_items`, etc.)
- [ ] Sample customer exists in database
- [ ] Sample bike exists linked to customer
- [ ] Job has valid `bike_id` and `customer_id`
- [ ] App is running latest built version
- [ ] No errors in Flutter console
- [ ] Supabase connection is working
