## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```sql
-- Connect to your Supabase database and run:

-- Step 1: Schema migration
-- Run contents of: supabase/sql/purchase_invoice_5status_migration.sql

-- Step 2: Triggers and functions
-- Run contents of: supabase/sql/purchase_invoice_triggers.sql
```

### 2. Verify Required Accounts

Ensure these accounts exist in `accounts` table:

- **1150** - Inventario (Asset)
- **1155** - Inventario en Tránsito (Asset) ← **New for prepayment**
- **1140** - IVA Crédito Fiscal (Asset)
- **2120** - Cuentas por Pagar (Liability)

### 3. Merge Service Extensions (Optional)

The 15 service methods in `purchase_service_extensions.dart` are ready to be merged into your main `PurchaseService` class, or you can keep them as an extension file.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Standard Model Testing

- [ ] Mark as Sent → verify `sent_date` populated
- [ ] Confirm invoice → enter supplier invoice number
- [ ] Mark as Received → verify inventory increased
- [ ] Check accounting: 1150, 1140, 2120 entries created
- [ ] Register payment → verify status = Paid
- [ ] Check accounting: 2120 debit, bank credit
- [ ] Undo payment → verify payment & journal deleted
- [ ] Revert to Confirmed → verify inventory decreased
- [ ] Revert to Sent → verify no errors
- [ ] Revert to Draft → verify clean state

### Prepayment Model Testing

- [ ] Create draft invoice (select "Prepago" model)
- [ ] Verify model badge shows "Prepago" with orange color

### UI Testing

## 🎬 How It All Flows

1. **User clicks "Nueva factura" button** → Dialog appears
2. **User selects model** (Standard or Prepayment) → Returns `true/false`
3. **Router receives** `/purchases/new?prepayment=true` → Parses query param
4. **Form page opens** with `isPrepayment=true` → Shows form
5. **User fills form and saves** → Creates invoice with `prepayment_model=true`
6. **List page refreshes** → Shows new invoice with "Prepago" badge
7. **User taps invoice** → Opens detail page
8. **Detail page shows timeline** → Prepayment order: Paid before Received
9. **User clicks action buttons** → Database triggers fire
10. **Inventory/Accounting updated automatically** → By SQL triggers
11. **Page refreshes** → Shows new status and updated buttons

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column 'prepayment_model' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the migration SQL first (`purchase_invoice_5status_migration.sql`)

### Issue: "Function 'handle_purchase_invoice_change' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the triggers SQL second (`purchase_invoice_triggers.sql`)

### Issue: "Account 1155 not found"
**Solution**: Run `MASTER_ACCOUNTING_FIX.sql` to create all required accounts

### Issue: "Inventory not updating"
**Solution**: Check `stock_movements` table for new entries. If missing, check trigger logs.

### Issue: "Journal entries not created"
**Solution**: Verify accounts 1150, 1155, 1140, 2120 exist and are active

### Issue: "Journal entries NOT deleted when reverting Confirmada → Enviada"
**This is the most common issue!**

**Symptoms**:
- Revert invoice from Confirmada to Enviada
- Journal entry still exists in database
- No error messages

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Run `supabase/sql/verify_purchase_invoice_triggers.sql`
2. Check if trigger is installed and enabled
3. Verify `entry_type` values match expected values

**Common Causes**:
- ❌ Trigger not installed (run `purchase_invoice_triggers.sql`)
- ❌ Trigger disabled (reinstall trigger)
- ❌ `entry_type` mismatch (entries have `NULL` or different values)
- ❌ Foreign key missing CASCADE delete

**Quick Fix**:
```sql
-- Reinstall trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS purchase_invoice_change_trigger ON purchase_invoices;

CREATE TRIGGER purchase_invoice_change_trigger
  AFTER UPDATE OF status
  ON purchase_invoices
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_purchase_invoice_change();
```

## 🎓 Key Implementation Decisions

1. **DELETE-based reversals** instead of REVERSAL entries (like Zoho Books)
   - Cleaner database
   - Simpler reporting
   - Easier to understand for users

2. **Per-invoice model selection** instead of global setting
   - More flexible
   - Supports mixed scenarios
   - Better UX (decision at creation time)

3. **SQL triggers handle ALL logic**
   - Consistent accounting
   - No missed entries
   - Audit-proof

4. **Conditional UI based on model + status**
   - Prevents user errors
   - Guides proper workflow
   - Clear expectations

5. **Timeline shows model-specific order**
   - Visual clarity
   - Educational for users
   - Reduces confusion
